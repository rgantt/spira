//! What `bd` is asked, and what comes back from it.
//!
//! ONE QUERY ANSWERS THE WHOLE GRAPH, and it took a wrong turn to find that out. The listing
//! carries each bead's typed dependency edges inline, on the rows that have any — so reading
//! the key set of the FIRST row and concluding the edges are absent is wrong, and the second
//! query written to recover them cost as much again as the listing itself. There is no cheap
//! second source: the batch dependency query runs one lookup per id and takes seconds, and
//! the graph formats drop either the type or the edges to beads that are no longer live.
