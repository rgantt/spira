//! Loom's read endpoint: one route, `GET /api/beads`, returning the live beads graph.
//!
//! WHAT IS AND IS NOT HERE. This serves the graph and nothing else — no layout, no
//! components, no buckets, no ranking. All of that measured 2 ms in the browser at the live
//! corpus and 60 ms at a hundred times it, so computing it here would buy nothing and cost a
//! rendering stack. The payload is the raw rows as `bd` returns them plus the dependency
//! edges between them, and the page derives every view from that.
//!
//! WHY THERE IS A BUDGET AT ALL. A query per request is the simple choice, and it is the
//! right one only while it stays cheap. The meter ships with the mechanism rather than after
//! it: the query's wall time is recorded and served, and a query that overruns is REFUSED
//! rather than served late. Serving a stale snapshot instead would be kinder to one reader
//! and fatal to the design, because it would hide the one signal that says the simple choice
//! has stopped being adequate.
//!
//! THE BUDGET BOUNDS THE QUERY, and the work either side of it is reported next to it as
//! `refresh_ms`. Parsing most of a megabyte of JSON is not free, and a refresh that grew slow
//! by growing its payload rather than its query would otherwise be invisible — the number
//! nobody publishes is the one that grows.
