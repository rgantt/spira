//! The endpoint against a REAL `bd` on a throwaway database, driven over a real socket.
//!
//! `spira/test-loom.sh` builds the fixture and runs this; it is the only intended entry
//! point, and these tests fail loudly rather than skipping when its environment is absent. A
//! suite that silently no-ops when its fixture is missing reports "0 failed" for a run that
//! checked nothing, which is indistinguishable from a pass in an exit code.
//!
//! Every assertion that something is ABSENT is paired with one that the same check can see
//! something present: a closed bead is in the fixture and must not appear, an invocation
//! counter is shown moving before its stillness means anything, and the budget is shown
//! admitting a query before it is shown refusing one.
