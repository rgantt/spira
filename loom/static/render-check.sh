# render-check.sh — drive the shipped page in a real browser and assert it painted.
#
#   loom/static/render-check.sh [payload.json]
#
# It serves this directory on a scratch port, loads every view in a headless browser, and
# checks the DOM afterwards. With no argument it uses `fixture.json`; pass a file holding a
# raw bead array to look at your own data.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A `spira/test-*.sh`. That glob is the population `suites.sh` runs unattended
# on a timer, and a browser is not something a clone — or that timer's environment — has any
# reason to have. A suite that skips on most machines trains everyone to ignore its skip line,
# which costs more than the coverage is worth. `spira/test-loom-page.sh` holds the half that
# needs no browser: the view model, and the structural properties of the page. This is the
# other half, run by hand when the page changes.
#
# EVERY ASSERTION HERE MUST BE UNSATISFIABLE BY THE STATIC MARKUP, and that is the whole
# lesson of the file. The first version looked for `<circle`, which the legend supplies
# whether or not anything rendered — so it reported six greens over a page whose render call
# had been dropped in a port. Assert on values only the painter can produce: a solved radius,
# a measured ink fraction, a tab whose selection was moved, a list built from beads.
