#   verify-asks.sh            # check and report; changes nothing
#   verify-asks.sh --apply    # close the ones whose own check now passes
#
# WHY, in the operator's own words on closing one: *"ran those commands to verify, but i already
# did this days ago. close it out."*
#
# That bead asked them to subscribe a calendar feed. It sat open for three days, and it
# carried the exact command that proves the work is done — `cal source list` showing one
# source. Nobody ran it. Run today it exits 0 and prints the source: the ask had been
# satisfied the whole time and was still sitting in their queue with their name on it.
#
# CLAUDE.md already said to prefer a machine check over asking, and cited three of nineteen
# items provable from systemd and the commit graph. That was advice, and advice is a thing to
# remember. This runs the check.
#
# THE CONVENTION. An operator ask carries a line in its description:
#
#     VERIFY: <shell command>
#
# exiting 0 when the ask is ALREADY SATISFIED. Keep it read-only — a listing, a `systemctl
# is-active`, a `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, a `test -f`. It runs unattended and it runs
# repeatedly, so anything with a side effect is a bug in the bead, not a clever shortcut.
#
# Closing carries the command's own output as evidence, because a bare tick is a claim with
# nothing behind it — so prefer a check that PRINTS what it found over one that is silent.
# `grep -q` closes the bead with empty evidence; `grep` without -q closes it with the
# matching line, which is the thing a human would actually want to see.
#
# THE beads database, via db.sh. This walked the town alone for a time, which meant
# sp-builder-cutover — Spira's first escalation, and one that carries a VERIFY line — had
# nothing that would ever run it.
