# WHY BEADS AND NOT A FILE
# ------------------------
# This used to write .runtime/asks.jsonl, a hand-rolled store, and it lost data: ids were a
# truncated timestamp plus a truncated random suffix, two asks filed in the same second
# collided, and because answering matched by id one reply closed both — recording a verdict
# against a question the operator never answered. Beads gives real identity, status, close reasons
# and comments, and one store rather than two. (The operator, verbatim: "the current data
# model is guaranteeing sync issues and data loss".)
#
# THE FOUR KINDS, AND THE TYPES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST
#   question  -> type `decision`, label $SPIRA_ASK_LABEL  open; the close reason IS the verdict
#   decision  -> type `decision`, label $SPIRA_ASK_LABEL  open; the close reason IS the verdict
#   insight   -> type `task`,     label insight      created CLOSED — there is nothing to do
#   note      -> type `event`,    NO labels at all   created CLOSED — an outcome, not work
#
# AN EVENT AND AN INSIGHT ARE DIFFERENT THINGS, and conflating them is what this verb exists
# to end. An EVENT is an outcome: what happened, written by the
# machinery, read and moved on from, with no thread. An INSIGHT is what was LEARNED during
# the work and might carry over — candidate law, doctrine or ruling — written by an agent.
# With only one bin, the machinery used the other one: three of the fourteen beads labelled
# `insight` were `PILGRIMAGE COMPLETE — <bead>: <title>` emitted by pilgrimage.sh (sp-94h,
# hq-5enm, sp-fv9, all now retyped). Those are outcomes wearing an insight's label, and they
# crowd out the thing the insights view is for.
#
# beads validates issue_type against a fixed set: task, bug, epic, feature, chore, decision,
# spike, rig, event. `question`, `insight`, `note` and `idea` are NOT types, whatever
# `bd create --dry-run` says — dry-run does not run the validator, so it accepted all four
# and the first real create rejected them. The taxonomy therefore lives in LABELS, with the
# type chosen from the real set.
#
# A question and a decision share the `decision` type deliberately rather than by compromise:
# the escalation policy already says an escalation is a decision request, not a problem
# report, so a question with a recommended default IS a decision awaiting a verdict.
#
# An insight exists because an answer that scrolls off screen is lost. It is neither a task
# nor a question, and before this there was nowhere to put one.
#
# `$SPIRA_ASK_LABEL` is the label on anything awaiting them — the SAME label the escalation gate and
# the mountain design already exclude, so a question can never be dispatched to a polecat as
# if it were work. No assignee is set, for the same reason: an assignee is how Gas Town routes
# work to an agent.

# `--default` is close to mandatory on a question: an ask without a recommendation makes the operator

#
# AND ON AN OPERATOR ASK — one where they runs a command — put a machine check in the body:
#
#     VERIFY: <read-only shell command exiting 0 once the ask is already satisfied>
#
# `verify-asks.sh` runs those on a timer and closes the ones that pass, with the output as
# evidence. One ask requested a subscription, sat in the queue three days, and
# carried the exact proving command in its own text: *"ran those commands to verify, but i
# already did this days ago. close it out."* The check existed; nothing ran it.

# nothing is blocked, that is the whole point of the kind -- and signed off by telling them to
# file a verdict against it. The framing they objected to was not a rendering choice; it was
# literally in the text, put there by this function.

# owed. `$1` is the kind, and the pane strips the old wording from the insights already
