# moot-sweep.sh — resolve asks whose MOOT-WHEN predicate now exits 0.
#
#   moot-sweep.sh [--apply]
#
# An auto-filed ask can record the condition that fired it as a MOOT-WHEN: line in its
# description:
#
#     MOOT-WHEN: <shell command exiting 0 when the condition has cleared>
#
# When that command exits 0 the alert condition is gone and the ask is no longer actionable.
# Without --apply this reports which asks would be resolved; with --apply it resolves them.
#
# THREE INVARIANTS
#
#   An ask with no MOOT-WHEN is NEVER touched. Hand-written escalations and policy questions
#   carry no mechanical predicate; auto-closing one would destroy an escalation the operator
#   never saw.
#
#   A predicate that errors or times out leaves the ask open. A failed probe must never read
#   as "condition cleared" — that is the ? not 0 rule (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
#   Resolution goes through resolve.sh, NEVER a raw bd close. A raw close is announced by
#   watch-answers.sh as an operator verdict; resolve.sh records the actor as claude so the
#   watcher knows not to page.
