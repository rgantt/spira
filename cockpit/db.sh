# (the operator, verbatim: "i don't think we need to keep the databases in sync here. let's
# just use the spira one for everything from here on out. i don't want this
# migration/deprecation to bake a bunch of complexity and modality into our tools.")
#
# Everything the cockpit raises, reads, answers and closes lives in Spira. There is no walk,
# no precedence order, no per-row `_db` tag and no dedupe, because all four existed for one
# reason — two live databases holding the same beads — and that reason is gone.
#
# They were also a bug factory in their own right, which is why they are deleted rather than
# configured down to one entry. A reply answered in the town left Spira's replica still
# reporting the thread unanswered; a dedupe recorded only the ids that complained, so an
# ANSWERED bead in the first database let a stale replica speak for it; and the shell tools
# were switched to Spira while the panel was not, splitting one conversation across two
# databases within the hour — their 18:54 comment landed in the town because the pane wrote
# there, while unanswered.sh read Spira and reported nothing waiting.
#
# Gas Town's own databases are not addressed from here at all, and nothing else addresses
# them either: `rule.sh` writes the statute book to this same database, and it is the one
# every aeon reads its law from at summon.
# Every path comes from the harness's one configuration surface. It is two directories
# away because the cockpit ships beside the harness, not inside it.

# (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).
#
# One function rather than the same three lines in each of five scripts: that duplication is
# exactly how the cockpit ended up with five copies of a database walk, four of which were
# never corrected when the fifth was. `bd --json` can print warnings on stdout BEFORE the
# payload, which is what the sed strips.

# Only the beads the attention surface is ABOUT, narrowed by the server rather than by the
# reader. `--label-any` is an OR, and these three labels are exactly what answers.py then
# filters on: the escalation label and `overseer` for a question, `insight` for an FYI, which
# is created closed and carries neither.
#
# WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FUNCTION. `cockpit_beads` promises every bead and something may yet
# want that; this promises a subset and says which. Measured on a live database: 1867 rows in
# 644ms against 109 rows in 342ms, every 45 seconds, forever — and the whole difference was
# being thrown away in Python one line later. It also keeps the payload well under
# answers.py's scan ceiling, which is announced but still a ceiling.
#
# A NARROWED QUERY IS A PLACE TO GO BLIND, which is why the label comes from configuration
# and never from a literal: an installation whose escalation label is its own would otherwise
# match nothing and report, in perfect silence, that nobody has answered anything
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). spira/test-cockpit-db.sh pins it to a non-default and
# asserts the count, so a literal written back in here fails the gate.
