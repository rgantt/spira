# answered-since.sh — at session start, report what the operator said while nobody was home.
#
# WHY. The live watcher only runs inside a live session. The operator answers from their
# phone and from the cockpit pane at hours when no session exists, and an answer delivered
# to nobody is worse than an unanswered question: they believe they have replied, and the
# next session cheerfully re-asks. One sat answered ("take your default") until they asked
# why nothing had happened.
#
# The SessionStart hook already reports what is still OPEN for them. This is its other half,
# and it covers BOTH ways they speak — a close carrying a verdict, and a comment. The comment
# leg is not a refinement: an FYI is created closed and carries no escalation label, so
# nothing here could ever have seen a reply left on one, and one sat unread until they said
# so. See spira/answers.py, which is also what the live watcher runs.
#
# Prints only what is past the marks, so an answer is announced once rather than every
# session for a day. The marks are written even when there is nothing to say.
