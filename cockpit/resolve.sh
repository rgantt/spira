# resolve.sh — close a bead I established or did myself, and do not page the operator about it.
#
#   resolve.sh <bead-id> "<reason>"
#   resolve.sh <bead-id> -            # reason on stdin
#
# WHY (the operator's call): *"for beads that are machine checkable... just go machine
# check them. i don't need to take action if you can. this is perfectly acceptable for
# non-destructive actions."* — law-check-it-yourself-before-asking.
#
# Closing is now routine for me, which created a second-order bug the moment it started:
# watch-answers.sh announced the harness's OWN close back to it as "THE OPERATOR ANSWERED".
# Authorship is recorded — beads writes an audit event of type `closed` carrying the actor,
# which `bd history <id> --events` reads — but it is NOT on the issue row, where there is no
# closed_by, and it is not the Dolt committer, which is the literal string "beads" whatever
# BEADS_ACTOR says. The watcher reads the event. BEADS_ACTOR below is what puts the right
# name on it; the id recorded here is the cheap pre-filter that saves reading the trail.
#
# Reasons carry their evidence. A close that says "done" is a claim with nothing behind it;
# quote the command and its output, so the bead is still readable as a decision months on.
