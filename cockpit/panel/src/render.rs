//! The panel's look: numbered tabs, a scannable list, and a permanent detail area.
//!
//! MASTER / DETAIL, not an expanding list. The pane is wide and short — about 107x19 — so a
//! list that grows inline when you select something pushes everything else off screen and
//! makes the list unscannable. Instead the list stays one line per item, always, and the
//! bottom third is a fixed area showing the selected item in full. Nothing moves as you
//! arrow through; only the detail changes. There is no expand key because there is nothing
//! to expand.
//!
//! TABS ARE NUMBERED because they are jumpable — 1, 2, 3 — and the number is the key.
//!
//! THE HEADER SAYS HOW OLD THE DATA IS. The store refreshes on a timer, so the panel is
//! always showing something slightly stale; saying so is the difference between a display
//! and a claim. It also says when a refresh is in flight, so a slow `bd` looks like work
//! rather than a freeze.
//!
//! FLICKER. Never clear the screen: home the cursor, erase per line as it is rewritten, and
//! skip the write entirely when the frame is unchanged. That is why every age here is
//! rendered in coarse buckets rather than exact seconds — an exact clock would change every
//! second and repaint the whole pane forever.
//!
//! AGE, NOT WALLCLOCK. Every stamp on an item says how long it has been OPEN — "26m", "7h",
//! "6d" — because that is the question this pane is asked. (the operator, verbatim: *"i want
//! to know how long the item has been open, not the wallclock time it was opened."*) A
//! wallclock time answers it only for someone holding the current time and willing to
//! subtract, and the format it replaced switched units at midnight — today's rows read
//! "16:04" and older ones "Sep02" — so the two rows most worth comparing were the two
//! rendered in incomparable notations. The absolute timestamp stays on the rule and in the
//! reader's header, BEHIND the age, because rows are cut from the right.
//!
//! ── LEGIBILITY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! This pane is nineteen rows tall and it is where every decision is read, so three rules
//! govern every colour and every row spent here. the operator: *"it's hard to read (small space,
//! poor coloring, bad framing)."*
//!
//! 1. CONTENT IS NEVER DIM. The body of a bead was rendered in `\x1b[2m` — faint grey on
//!    black, the least readable thing on the screen — while the chrome around it was full
//!    brightness. That is the contrast budget spent backwards. Body text is `TXT`, bright
//!    white; `MUT` and the band backgrounds are for chrome, and nothing else.
//!
//! 2. THE FRAME IS TWO BANDS. The header and the footer sit on a filled background and
//!    nothing else in the pane does. Everything between them is content, by construction,
//!    and the eye finds the boundary without reading a word. Before this the tabs, the
//!    list and the key hints all rendered as text on the same black.
//!
//! 3. EVERY ROW IS EARNED. Three of nineteen rows are chrome and that is the whole budget:
//!    the rule between list and detail also NAMES the selected item, so the id / badge /
//!    timestamp line the detail used to spend a row on is free. And when the detail needs
//!    fewer rows than it was given, the surplus goes back to the list instead of being
//!    painted as blank lines under a short body.
