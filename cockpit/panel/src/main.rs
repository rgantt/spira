//! panel — the cockpit's bottom-left pane: decisions, FYI, notifications and alerts.
//!
//!     panel           interactive

//!
//! WHY IT EXISTS
//! -------------
//! Chat is a log, and a log cannot hold an open question. (the operator, verbatim: *"you'll
//! spit out 1,000 lines of shit and i don't even see the original thing you asked for"*.)
//! This is where a thing stays put while the transcript scrolls past it, and where the operator acts
//! on it without retyping which one they mean — *"an intuitive TUI for interacting with
//! certain kinds of beads out of band of our normal conversation"*.
//!
//! KEYS
//!     j k ↑ ↓     move                    tab / shift-tab   view
//!     d           act — close / dismiss / mark read / acknowledge, one keypress, no prompt
//!     D           the same, but prompt for a reason (not in ALERTS — see below)
//!     ⏎           decide (decisions) / comment (FYI, ALERTS)
//!     L           in FYI: enact — compose a statute from this insight and cite it
//!     s           in ALERTS: silence this condition for an hour
//!     h           in FYI and ALERTS: show the history; d there undoes
//!     r           force a sync            esc  cancel input
//!
//! `d` acts immediately because dismissing should not cost a sentence: *"i may want to
//! comment on an insight, but other times i can just read it and move on."*
//!
//! NOTHING IN THIS PANE CLOSES AN ALERT. An alert is a condition that self-clears, so the
//! only thing that may retract it is whatever asserted it; `D` is therefore unbound there,
//! and `d` acknowledges without touching the bead's status. A hand-closed alert whose
//! condition is still true comes straight back on the next pass, which would teach the operator that
//! acting on this tab does nothing — the exact way a pane becomes wallpaper
//! (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).
//!
//! NOTHING BLOCKS ON A SUBPROCESS. The store refreshes on a background thread; the UI only
//! reads the last snapshot and filters it in memory. Tab switching used to re-run two
//! identical `bd list` queries plus a mail query on every keypress — 1134 ms + 1134 ms +
//! 816 ms — which is what the operator measured as *"almost 5 seconds to switch tabs."*
//!
//! ACTIONS ARE OPTIMISTIC. The row disappears the moment you press the key, and the store
//! re-syncs behind it. Waiting a second for `bd` to confirm what you just asked for is the
//! same latency by another name.
