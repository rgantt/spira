//! The panel used to call `load()` for every view on every tab switch: two identical

//! Measured — `bd` 1134 ms, `gt mail` 816 ms — that is over three seconds of subprocess
//! before spawn overhead, on a keypress. the operator: *"almost 5 seconds to switch tabs."*
//!
//! So the process boundary is crossed on a TIMER, never on a keystroke. A background thread
//! owns refreshing; the UI thread only ever reads the last snapshot and filters it in
//! memory. Switching tabs costs nothing, and a slow or hung `bd` can never freeze the pane —
//! it just means the snapshot is a few seconds old, which the header says out loud.
//!
//! There used to be a second fetch here — `gt mail inbox`, 816 ms, run concurrently with the
//! beads query so a refresh cost max() rather than the sum. It is gone with the town it read:
//! nothing has written to that mailbox since the 2026-09-05 cutover, so it was 1,440 subprocess
//! calls a day into a decommissioned harness to render a tab that could only be empty or
