//! What the panel shows, and what acting on each kind actually means.
//!
//! Four views, because there are four genuinely different things and collapsing them
//! loses what makes each useful:
//!
//! | view | what it is | lives in | acting on it |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | DECISIONS | open work on the operator | beads, the escalation label + `overseer` | close it; the reason IS the verdict |
//! | FYI | something already true | beads, `insight`+`overseer` | dismiss it — read and move on |
//! | NOTIFICATIONS | something already happened | beads, `issue_type: event` | mark it read |
//! | ALERTS | a condition that is true NOW | beads, `event`+`alert`+`overseer` | acknowledge it, or silence it for an hour |
//!
//! An INSIGHT is closed by construction: there is nothing to do, only something to know. It
//! exists because an answer that scrolls off screen is lost. A NOTIFICATION is an OUTCOME —
//! a landing, a reclaim, a CI verdict, a gate stall. Those flash on the health pane's RECENT
//! line and scroll away with no durable surface anywhere.
//!
//! IT USED TO READ GAS TOWN MAIL, and kept reading it for a day after the town was
//! decommissioned: nothing had written to that mailbox since the 2026-09-05 cutover, so the
//! tab could only be empty or historical while the store paid ~816 ms per 60 s refresh —
//! 1,440 subprocess calls a day — to find out. Repointed rather than dropped, because the
//! gap it now fills is real and the rows were already in the snapshot: `bd list --all`
//! returns events, and both surviving filters were throwing them away.
//!
//! WHY THE INSIGHTS TAB SAYS "FYI" (the operator, verbatim: *"these insights seem more like bug
//! reports which means they're implicitly asking me for feedback -- really they should be FYI
//! only"*). The view rendered in the same shape as DECISIONS — a `default:` line, a turn
//! marker saying whose ball it was, a footer offering `⏎ decide` — and the bodies themselves
//! were written by `ask.sh` from the ESCALATION template, so an insight opened with
//! "**What is blocked:**" and closed by telling them to record a verdict. Nothing about it
//! said "record". Every one of those affordances is now view-aware, and the tab is named for
//! what the view is rather than for the label the beads carry.
//!
//! AN ALERT IS NOT A DECISION, and the discriminator is LIFECYCLE, not urgency: an alert is a
//! condition that SELF-CLEARS, a decision is one that gets ANSWERED. If the loop unwedges on
//! its own the alert must vanish with nobody touching it. Everything in the other three tabs
//! persists until the operator acts on it, and that property is what makes DECISIONS worth
//! trusting — nothing leaves unless they moved it. Mixing in items that disappear by
//! themselves teaches that not acting is sometimes fine, which is corrosive to the one list
//! where acting is the point. Two more differences follow: an alert may fire, clear and
//! re-fire for one cause, while a decision asked twice is a defect the statute book exists to
//! prevent; and an alert carries no recommended default, because there is nothing to choose
//! until they have looked.
//!
//! IT IS CALLED "ALERTS", NOT "ESCALATIONS". Escalation already means something exact in the
//! escalation policy and in several statutes — a bead carrying the escalation label, a
//! decision, a default, and what is blocked. Reusing the word for a machine-generated
//! condition would blur the one term that policy rests on.
//!
//! AND AN ALERT DOES NOT CARRY THE ESCALATION LABEL, which is why the DECISIONS filter has to
//! exclude it explicitly rather than merely not matching it: an alert bead carries `overseer`,
//! and DECISIONS admits the escalation label OR `overseer`, so without that exclusion every
//! firing alert would appear in the one list this whole design exists to keep self-clearing
//! items out of. The label is withheld deliberately — the escalation label is excluded from
//! every fayth predicate and from the guard that forbids closing through a resolve, so
//! carrying it would stop the writer clearing its own alert when the condition passes.
//!
//! AND A DISMISSED INSIGHT LEAVES THE PANE, but stays reachable: `d` adds `archived`, `h`
//! shows the archived ones and `d` there takes the label back off. An acknowledged item that
//! stays put teaches the operator to ignore the pane, which is law-alerts-must-be-actionable wearing
//! a different hat; an acknowledged item that vanishes irrecoverably makes dismissing it a
//! decision, which is the cost this view exists to avoid.
//!
//! Reading lives in `store`; this module only defines the vocabulary and the writes.

// ── promotion: an insight becomes a statute ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// AN INSIGHT IS A CANDIDATE LAW. It is what was learned during the
// work that might carry over — doctrine or a ruling, though not usually couched that way —
// so the implicit question on an FYI row is not "do you want to act on this?" but "should
// this be law?", and that is answerable three ways while the view offered two.
//
// The pipeline already ran; it simply left no trace. Four of the nine live insights were
// already doctrine — the disk box with the dead alert channel became
// law-absence-needs-a-positive-control, a bead closed over a red PR with the statute already
// in force was a RE-violation, which is the ladder's promotion trigger — and every one was
// promoted by hand and then archived with the same label as an insight shrugged off as
// noise. So the feeder for a forty-statute book had no surface, and a statute could not point
// back at the case that produced it, which is exactly what CLAUDE.md asks of one.

/// The label prefix a promoted insight carries: `enacted:law-<slug>`.
///
/// `store` reads it onto `Item::enacted` and the row renders differently for it, so a
/// promoted finding is visibly distinct from a dismissed one on the surface Ryan reads.

/// hold across a keypress for a separator this cheap. A colon inside the statute is safe
/// because the slug cannot contain one.
///
/// It refuses rather than guesses. A slug is `[a-z0-9-]`, which is what `rule.sh` will turn
/// into a memory key every agent reads; anything else — a missing colon, capitals, a space —
/// would otherwise reach the statute book as a key nobody can address, and the caller keeps
/// the draft so the text typed is never the thing that is lost.
