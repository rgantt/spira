# tmux-env.sh — keep one Claude session's identity out of the tmux server's environment.

#   tmux-env.sh scrub [-L sock]  remove them from a live server's global environment
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# tmux gives every new pane THE SERVER'S environment, captured once when the server was
# forked and then frozen for the server's whole life. So a tmux server started from inside a
# Claude Code session hands that session's identity to every pane it will ever open — for
# days, across reboots of everything except tmux itself.
#
# On 2026-09-09 the cockpit server (pid 1640264) had been forked by cockpit/rebuild.sh
# running inside an archivist AEON. It captured CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION=1, and the
# operator's own brain session — opened in a pane of that server hours later — inherited it.
# A client that believes it is a child session DOES NOT WRITE A TRANSCRIPT. Two things then
# broke at once, and neither error named the cause:
#
#   ⚠ Transcript saving is off — inherited CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION marker
#   CTX    no session at the keyboard          (ctx-meter.sh finds no transcript to read)
#
# It also carried a STALE CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID and a CLAUDE_CODE_EXECPATH pinned to a
# client version that had since been replaced, so the operator's session reported the aeon's
# session id and an older binary's path.
#
# WHY SCRUB RATHER THAN SET. There is no correct value for any of these in a shared server:
# they identify one session, and a pane is not that session. Absent is the only right answer;
# a real client sets its own on startup.
#
# CLAUDE_EFFORT AND THE THEME ARE DELIBERATELY LEFT. They are operator preferences that mean
# the same thing in any pane. Only session IDENTITY is poison.
#

# Session identity, in the order the client sets them. Anything that names ONE session,
# ONE process or ONE installed client belongs here.
