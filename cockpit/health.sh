# under $SPIRA_RUN. NEVER calls `bd` or `git` itself: the expensive sources cost seconds a pass
# and a pane that shelled out would freeze on every repaint.
#
# WHY ONLY SPIRA
# --------------
# This pane used to instrument only the predecessor harness, while the harness actually running
# the operator's work — sentinel, aeons, the landing gate — had no display at all. A dashboard
# whose subject is a decommissioned system reports on the past, and worse, trains the eye to
# skip the pane.
#
# WHAT IS ON IT, AND WHY THOSE
# ----------------------------
# The selection rule is the operator's: **instrument the numbers that surprised us.** Every line is
# something whose real value differed from what a reasonable person would assume, in a way
# that cost time. For Spira they are the ones this build itself got wrong:
#
#   born → lived     the first aeon ever summoned was killed inside the same second by the
#                    oneshot's cgroup teardown, while the sentinel reported "summoned" every
#                    two minutes into an empty log. A summon is not a worker.
#   closed → landed  CLOSED IS NOT LANDED. A bead closed with no commit naming it unblocks
#                    its dependents on a lie.
#   falseACT         CHECK 6 re-landed one branch forever because `git branch -D` refuses a
#                    branch a worktree holds and the error went to /dev/null. `acted` was
#                    therefore never 0, and CHECK 8 fires only when `acted` is 0 — so the
#                    harness could not notice it was starved. The reclaim probe had already
#                    done the same by matching its own idle message.
#   judgement        both of those bugs worked by making the judgement tier unreachable.
#                    "never fired" and "fired 40 passes ago" look identical from outside.
#   sentinel age     strand.sh cannot detect that the sentinel is dead, because a check
#                    cannot observe the failure of the thing running it. This pane can.
#
# A `?` means the probe FAILED. It never renders as 0 — a panel that reports a broken check
# as "all clear" displaces the suspicion that would have prompted a look.
#
# THE FRAME IS SIZED TO THE PANE, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
# --------------------------------------------------------
# The pane is a full-height column (layout.sh splits it off the whole window), and how many
# rows that is depends on the operator's terminal. So the four sections that have more to
# say than fits — NOW, NEXT, RECENT, CI — each report every row they COULD show, and the
# renderer hands out the rows that are actually there.
#
# THE SHARE IS ROUND-ROBIN, ONE ROW AT A TIME, and that is the point. Filling each section
# in turn until the space runs out means a busy NOW pushes CI off the bottom, and CI is
# where a run that never came back is found — the section most likely to be starved is the
# one nothing else reports. Every section gets its first row before any gets its second.
#
# Sizing reads the pane's height on every repaint rather than trapping SIGWINCH, so a
# resize reflows on the next tick instead of waiting for fresh data.
#
# A SECTION WITH NOTHING TO SHOW STILL SAYS SO, and says which nothing it means: "no aeon
# working" is the harness idle, "?" is the snapshot unread. Rendering the second as the
# first is the all-clear a broken check must never be able to produce
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# Lines are still emitted in priority order and the frame is still cut to the terminal's
# real height, with the count of dropped lines marked on the header: seven lines were once
# written into five and the top two scrolled away unannounced, and a dashboard that hides
# its own content is the failure mode it exists to prevent.

# THE FRAME IS MEASURED IN CHARACTERS, and a good half of them are multibyte — `·`, `—`,
# `↳`, `▾`, `●`. Under systemd, under a gate's `env -i`, and in any detached pane, LANG is
# unset and bash falls back to the C locale, where `${t:0:n}` counts BYTES: a title cut at a
# byte boundary ends in a broken character, and every width calculation is wrong by however

# ======================================================================================
# SPIRA — the sections, each answering one question, each sized by the caller.
#
# Every section function emits EVERY row it could show, most important first. None of them
# knows how tall the pane is; `frame` decides that, so no section can eat the space of the
# one below it merely by being written first.
# ======================================================================================

# How many rows one elastic section may ever occupy. Past this a section stops being a
# glance and becomes a list, which is what `bd ready` is for. The collector caps its own
# output to match — there is no point emitting rows nothing can show.
MAX_SECTION_ROWS=20

# NEXT AND RECENT ARE FIVE ROWS, AND INFLOW IS THE ELASTIC ONE.
#
# All three numbers below exist because the column has slack to place and only one sensible
# place to put it. The slack itself was the earlier finding: held at five each, NEXT and
# RECENT spent the pane's slack rather than the pane — on the 52-row column this runs in an
# idle harness rendered about eighteen rows and left thirty blank, because once every section
# had reached its `want` the round-robin had nowhere left to put the budget. Raising both to
# forty fixed the blank rows and answered the question with the sixth, seventh and eighth
# entries of two ordered lists, which is the least any of those rows could have said: nobody
# reads the eighth-most-recent landing.
#
# So NEXT and RECENT are a HEIGHT again, and the slack goes to INFLOW — the newest beads in
# the store, which is the one section whose extra rows are worth having. A growing store reads
# as a busy harness whichever way it grew, and the two cases are opposite: beads arriving
# because a design was decomposed is progress, and beads arriving because one broken thing
# keeps reporting itself is a defect wearing throughput's clothes. The operator, reading an
# hour of it: "11 of the 12 beads right now are from the timed test run." (per Ryan,
# 2026-09-12)
#
# THEY STAY THREE KEYS RATHER THAN ONE. They answer different questions and will not stay the
# same number — a shared constant is how two sections come to be resized together by someone
# who meant to resize one.
#
# THE COLLECTOR MUST AGREE. A ceiling here that the collector does not emit rows for is a
# section that silently renders short; `spira/cockpit.sh` caps SP_NEXT, SP_EVENT and
# SP_INFLOW to these same figures, and the pairs are commented at each other on purpose.
#
# The generic cap above still governs CI, which is a list of work parked since yesterday and

# TOKENS — what the account is spending, and which half of the system is spending it.
#
# DIRECTLY UNDER THE HEADER AND OUTSIDE THE SHARE, because it is the constraint on everything
# below it: when the account is out of capacity no aeon can be summoned and no bead can move,
# so every other figure on this pane freezes for a reason nothing else here reports. It is the
# leading indicator of the GOV row's "ACCOUNT OUT OF CAPACITY", which only says so once it is
# too late to act. Fixed height by the same rule as the standing figures — each row is one
# number that is always worth its row — so the elastic sections never elide it.
#
# THE SPLIT IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it gets a row each. A single total would not have answered
# the question this was built for, and the answer was not the obvious one: the interactive
# session is about three quarters of the window, so optimising the harness first would have
# been optimising the smaller half. One half per row rather than both on one, because this is
# a column about a third of the window wide and the tail of a long line is silently cut — the
# tail here being the session, which is the larger half and the finding.
#
# CONTEXT PER TURN, NOT OUTPUT. What a rate limit meters is everything a request carried, and
# the whole context is re-read on EVERY turn: cache reads outweigh output here by roughly 175
# to 1. The lever is context size multiplied by turns, so both are on the row.

# share <rows> <fixed> <base:max:first...> -> one allocation per section, on its own line
#
# ROUND-ROBIN, ONE ROW AT A TIME. Filling each section to its cap in turn is the obvious
# implementation and the wrong one: NOW spends three rows per working aeon, so on a busy
# day it would take the whole column and CI — the section that reports a run parked since
# yesterday, and the only place that fact appears — would be the one to vanish.
#
# THREE TIERS, BECAUSE TWO ROUND-ROBINS CANNOT SAY ALL THREE THINGS. Every section names a
# BASE it needs, a MAX it could use, and whether it is served FIRST. The first-served
# sections — NOW, UNLANDED, CI — fill to their max before any other section reaches its
# base: this is the guarantee that NOW fills before the three list sections compete for
# budget. Without tier 0, a fair round-robin over all sections handed NOW only 9 of its 12
# rows on a 45-row pane while NEXT and RECENT each held five — the section describing work
# in flight trimmed to feed the ones that fill space. Tier one then fills every remaining
# section to its base; tier two is the slack, where only a section with room above its base
# bids (INFLOW).
#
# FIRST-SERVED IS DECLARED, NOT INFERRED FROM base == max. It was inferred, and the day NEXT
# and RECENT stopped being elastic they silently joined tier 0 and drank the budget ahead of
# INFLOW's floor — a section that had just been given a five-row guarantee rendered one row
# on a three-aeon pane. Nothing in the spec had said those two were first-served; the
# equality that made them so was a side effect of capping them. A section's PLACE IN THE
# QUEUE and its SIZE are two facts, and a shape that derives one from the other cannot be
# changed without changing both.
#
# EVERY SECTION KEEPS ITS FIRST ROW even when there is no budget for it. The overflow then
# falls off the BOTTOM of the frame in `render`, which marks the count on the header; a
# section quietly allocated zero rows would leave no such mark.

    # that swings with the state of the world, so it is the one the column has to absorb:
    # every row it takes when three aeons wake up has to come from somewhere, and every row it
    # gives back when they finish has to go somewhere. With every section pinned, the
    # giving-back had nowhere to go and the bottom of the pane simply went blank. INFLOW is
    # now the section that takes it — see MAX_INFLOW_ROWS for why it is that one and not NEXT

    # are now heights rather than ceilings — so there is no slack in them to give away and
    # nothing to gain by asking for more than they have. INFLOW bids the five it is guaranteed
    # and everything it rendered, and is therefore the only bidder in tier two.

# --- flicker-free painting -------------------------------------------------------
# `\e[2J` (clear screen) then redraw is what makes a pane flicker: for one frame the
# terminal shows nothing, and the eye catches it every tick. Four fixes together:
#
#   1. NEVER clear. Home the cursor, then erase each line as it is rewritten (\e[K)
#      and erase whatever is left below (\e[J). The old frame is overwritten in place,
#      so no blank frame ever exists.
#   2. NO TRAILING NEWLINE on the last line. A newline written in the bottom row scrolls
#      the pane by one, which is the other half of why the top lines were disappearing.
#   3. SKIP UNCHANGED FRAMES. Most ticks change nothing; comparing to the previous
#      frame turns those into zero writes. This is why the header shows the COLLECTION
#      time rather than the wall clock — a ticking second hand would defeat it.
#   4. SYNCHRONIZED OUTPUT (DECSET 2026). tmux buffers the whole update and presents it
#      atomically, so a repaint cannot be shown half-finished. Harmless where absent.
#   5. AUTOWRAP OFF (DECAWM). A line wider than the pane must be cut by the terminal, not
#      folded onto a second row: a folded line makes one printed line occupy two rows, and
#      the height arithmetic in `render` is then wrong by however many lines are long —
#      which is the scrolling bug arriving by a second route. Restored on exit.
#
# The cursor is hidden too — a block cursor parked in a dashboard is its own distraction.
# term_rows -> the pane's real height.
#
# `stty size` first, because it asks the TTY by ioctl and needs no terminfo: `tput lines`
# prints nothing and fails when $TERM is unset, which happens to anything launched
# detached — and its failure would fall through to "no limit", which is fail-OPEN on
# exactly the defect this function exists to close. When the height cannot be established
# at all, assume a small pane: under-rendering shows a ▾ count on the header and is visible
# and recoverable, while over-rendering scrolls the top lines away in silence. Five is
# deliberately pessimistic — the cockpit gives this pane a full column, so a fallback sized
