#                 <---- 100% - COCKPIT_RIGHT_PCT ---> <-- RIGHT_PCT ->
#
# ORDER IS THE GEOMETRY
# ---------------------
# The health pane is split off the WHOLE WINDOW first, which is what gives it the window's
# full height; only then is the remaining left column divided between the session and the
# panel. Split the bottom band first and halve it — as this once did — and the right pane
# can only ever be a quadrant, because by the time it exists its height is already the
# band's. A dashboard with a column's worth of rows is not a cosmetic change: health.sh
# sizes each of its sections to the rows it is given, and in five rows every section is cut
# to one.
#
# PANES ARE ADDRESSED BY TAG, NEVER BY INDEX
# ------------------------------------------
# tmux RENUMBERS pane indices the moment a pane dies, and the session pane is the one most
# likely to die — it holds a shell the operator can exit. When it did, the panel became pane 0 and
# `health` became pane 1, and every index in this script then pointed at the wrong thing:
# `down` killed health and left the panel owning the whole window, and `up` saw two panes,
# decided the cockpit was absent, and SPLIT THE DECISIONS PANE — the top half shrinking and
# the bottom-left growing on each run, which is exactly what the operator reported.
#
# So each dashboard pane carries a pane-scoped option `@cockpit` (panel|health) and is
# resolved by pane id through it. Identity survives renumbering; an index does not.
#
# `up` is a REPAIR, not just a create. It normalises whatever it finds: if the session pane
# is gone it opens a fresh shell at the top before touching anything else (the window must
# never reach zero panes, or it dies and takes the session with it), then rebuilds the dashboards.
#
# WHAT THIS MUST NOT BREAK
# ------------------------
# `cockpit` is built from LINKED WINDOWS: `cockpit:1` and `hunk:0` are the same window
# object, as are `cockpit:2` and `brain:0` — the flip between review and session is tmux
# window navigation over shared panes, not two copies. So a split here is visible from
# both session names, which is what makes the dashboard persist across the flip back.
#
# The session pane is never respawned or killed. `hunk-open.sh` sends keys to the session's
# ACTIVE pane, so this script always restores the session pane as active before exiting.
# Leaving a bottom pane selected would send the next review's launch command into a dashboard.
#
# The panes run renderers that only read a snapshot file — `$SPIRA_RUN/cockpit.env`, written
# by `spira-cockpit.service`. This script does not supervise that collector and must not start
# one: a probe pass costs seconds, and a pane that shelled out would stall on every repaint.
# Layout repair and metric collection are separate concerns under separate units.
#
# `ensure` — WHAT THE WATCHER CALLS
# ---------------------------------
# `cockpit-remote watch` calls this on its poll loop so the layout self-heals: the session
# pane holds a shell the operator can exit, and nothing else notices when they do. It repairs only
# a cockpit that is ALREADY UP — a window with `@cockpit` panes but no session pane left.
#
# The absence of any `@cockpit` pane means `down` was run, and `ensure` must leave that
# alone. An unattended process that rebuilds the dashboards the operator just dismissed is not a fence,
# it is a fight. Same reason it heals wherever the tagged panes actually are rather than
# at a hardcoded `brain:0`.
#
# It is SILENT on a healthy cockpit — a heartbeat that prints "fine" every 15s buries the
# one line that says it repaired something. Repairs are logged to `.runtime/cockpit-heal.log`,
# because self-healing that leaves no trace is how nobody learns the shell keeps dying.

# tell": every caller compares it against a file mtime, and 0 means infinitely old, so a
# failed probe reads as "running code from before the file existed" and triggers a repair.
#
# That is not hypothetical. `ps` gets slow and drops requests when the box is loaded, and over
# one 70-minute window -- while CI, a container build and the visual suite were all running --
# a caller of this respawned its subject 2212 times on failed probes alone. Each restart added
# load, which made the next probe likelier to fail. A repair loop that feeds on its own load is
# worse than the staleness it exists to catch, so the remaining callers respawn a PANE, which
# is cheap; nothing here supervises a process any more.
#
# The dashboard learned this already: a failed probe renders `?`, never 0.
# GHOST CLIENT DETACHMENT. With window-size latest (the server default), whichever client
# most recently changed its active window determines the cockpit window height. Ghost clients —
# terminals that have been idle for days but remain attached — periodically become "latest"
# and shrink the cockpit window to their small terminal height, causing the NEXT/RECENT
# sections to flap between ~5 and ~14 rows tick to tick.
#
# Two complementary defences:
#
#   1. detach_idle_clients removes the root cause: a client that has been idle longer than
#      COCKPIT_CLIENT_IDLE_SECS (default 6 h) is detached and cannot become "latest".
#
#   2. window-size largest (set in `up` and repaired by `ensure`) provides defence in depth:
#      even if a ghost reconnects briefly before the next ensure run, the server picks the
#      largest attached client — always the operator's live terminal — rather than the most
#      recently active one. `window-size manual` would also prevent the flap, but it freezes
#      the window at the size at creation time and never follows the operator's terminal when
#      they resize it. `window-size latest` with aggressive-resize on is the old per-window
#      smallness heuristic and does not help here. `window-size largest` responds to resize
#      while ignoring activity order, which is exactly what the cockpit needs.
