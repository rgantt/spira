# rebuild.sh — bring the whole cockpit back from nothing, including after the tmux server dies.
#
#   rebuild.sh probe        say what is wrong and change nothing
#   rebuild.sh              do it: clear a dead server, make the sessions, build the cockpit
#   rebuild.sh --force      also clear a wedged server that still holds live panes
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `layout.sh up` REPAIRS a cockpit; it cannot create one. Its first line is
# `tmux has-session || exit 1`, so when the tmux server itself dies there is no session for it
# to repair and the operator is left assembling five steps by hand in the right order. On
# 2026-09-09 the server on the default socket wedged and took the cockpit, both dashboards and
# every Monitor with it; the recovery took a dozen commands and two wrong turns, and the
# ordering matters in ways nothing wrote down.
#
# THE ORDERING THAT MATTERS, which is most of what this script is:
#
#   1. A wedged server must be cleared before anything else. It holds the socket, so every
#      later step fails in a way that looks like a different bug.
#   2. The dashboards go in `brain:0`, NOT in a new `cockpit` window. `cockpit` is not a
#      session that owns windows — it holds LINKED copies of `brain:0` and `hunk:0`, and
#      flipping between wiki work and review is a `select-window` over those links. Build the
#      layout in a fresh cockpit window and you get something that renders correctly, passes a
#      casual look, and is not the cockpit: the view watcher goes DEGRADED because the window
#      it steers is not the window it is looking at.
#   3. So: sessions first, layout into `brain:0`, and only then `cockpit-remote build` to link
#      them. Reverse the last two and the links point at a window with no dashboards in it.
#
# WEDGED IS NOT DEAD, AND THE DIFFERENCE DECIDES WHETHER KILLING IS SAFE. The failure that
# prompted this was a server that was alive, sleeping, holding its listening socket, using 36
# of 1024 fds — and answering every client with an instant EOF. `tmux list-sessions` said
# "server exited unexpectedly" in 11ms while the process sat in `ps`. Neither "is the process
# there" nor "does the socket file exist" tells you anything; the only question that
# discriminates is WHETHER IT ANSWERS, so that is the probe.
#
# AND A SERVER THAT HOLDS LIVE PANES IS NOT THIS SCRIPT'S TO KILL. A wedged server whose panes
# are all gone is a corpse holding a socket and clearing it costs nothing. A wedged server with
# live descendants is somebody's unsaved work — an aeon mid-claim, a review, a shell with
# something in it — and killing that is a decision, not a repair. Refused by default, and
# `--force` is the operator saying they have looked.
