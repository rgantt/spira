# test-gate-budget.sh — the gate declares a time budget; exceeding it files a bead against
# the harness and does NOT fail the branch.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. The previous 43-suite gate grew to 17 minutes not because anyone
# decided to have one that long, but because each suite was added one at a time and the total
# was never measured against an explicit limit. This bead adds SPIRA_GATE_BUDGET and makes
# gate-spira.sh time itself. The suite proves three properties:
#
#   1. The per-check cost and total appear in the output on every run, so the timed run and
#      the cockpit pane can both read them (positive control — a silent cost line reads
#      identically whether it was never computed or just never shown).
#   2. A budget overrun files a bead against the harness and exits with the SUITES' verdict,
#      not with a budget-specific code — the branch did not cause the overrun.
#   3. A second overrun does not file a second bead (deduplication).
