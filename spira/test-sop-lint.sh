# test-sop-lint.sh — sop.sh lint catches malformed SOPs that bypassed the write validator.
#
# THE BACK DOOR. `sop.sh write` validates every SOP before storing it; `bd remember sop-<slug>`
# does not — it is the route a direct database write takes, and the one that produced
# sop-spira-sweep: 236 words of prose, no fields, findable only by weak key-token fallback.
# `sop.sh lint` is what closes that door: it reads every sop- key and applies the write
# validator's own rules, so a runbook written directly cannot pass unnoticed.
#
# THIS SUITE IS THE POSITIVE CONTROL FOR THAT CHECK. A lint that reports clean on an empty
# shelf proves nothing — an empty result and a blind check look identical from outside. The
# only proof is planting a malformed SOP via the back door and requiring lint to name it.
