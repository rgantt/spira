# test-sop.sh — an SOP application leaves a record, and a session that left none is
#               DISTINGUISHABLE from one that did.
#
#   ./test-sop.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# The Ops brief told an aeon to match a runbook, run its CHECK, then run its FIX — and
# nothing wrote down that any of it happened. A session that matched an SOP and ignored it
# left exactly the trace of one that executed it faithfully, so nobody could say of any SOP
# on the shelf how often it fired, how often it was applied, or how often the incident came
# back anyway. `sop.sh applied` is that record and this is the suite that holds it.
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST IS A DISTINCTION, NOT A VALUE. Everything downstream — the check
# that fires on a silent Ops session, the numbers that will say which runbooks work — rests
# on being able to tell three states apart:
#
#   the ledger was read and holds a record for this bead          exit 0, the line on stdout
#   the ledger was read and holds nothing for this bead           exit 1, a TRUE absence
#   the ledger could not be read at all                           exit 2, NOT an absence
#
# A two-valued answer would merge the second and third, and the merged one reads as
# all-clear (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). So every assertion below that something
# is ABSENT is preceded, in the same fixture, by proof that the same read finds the same
# thing when it is present — and the unreadable cases are asserted as 2 rather than as 1.
#
# A REAL `bd` ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE. Half of what `applied` must do is put a note on a
# bead, and a stub `bd` would reproduce the surface this suite remembers rather than the one
# `sop.sh` actually calls (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). The shelf is real too: the slug
# check reads `bd memories`, and its whole subtlety is telling "the shelf is empty" from "the
# shelf could not be read", which no model of bd would get right by accident.
#
# THE ENVIRONMENT IS EXPLICIT AND MINIMAL, and SPIRA_SOP_LEDGER and SOP_WHY_CAP ARE PINNED TO
# NON-DEFAULTS. A suite that inherits a real spira.conf asserts against one box, one that
# inherits SPIRA_WIKI writes into a real wiki page, and one that asserts against the shipped
# ledger path passes just as well if the code has that path written in — which is the thing
# the key exists to stop (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).

# WHAT IS PASSED, AND WHY EACH ONE. `env -i` names the whole environment rather than

# sends `synth` into a real wiki page. Three things have to be passed anyway:
#
#   HOME        the REAL one. `bd` and `dolt` read their own configuration and credentials
#               from it, so a fixture home makes every database call fail — as "the shelf is
#               unreadable", which is a state this suite also tests for and would then be
#               asserting about the fixture rather than about the code.
#   PATH        where the binaries are, before conf.sh rewrites it.
#   SPIRA_PATH  and that rewrite is why. conf.sh REPLACES PATH with its own list so a systemd
#               timer resolves `bd`, and SPIRA_PATH is the key that puts the operator's
#               binaries back on the front of it. Omit it and the program under test loses
#               `bd` entirely, which presents as every database assertion failing at once.
