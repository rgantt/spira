#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A suite that nothing runs is not a cheap test, it is a false record of
# coverage — worse than no suite, because its existence is what stops anybody writing the
# check it was supposed to be (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Measured once: nine
# suites in the tree, four named by the gate, FIVE executed by nothing at all, three of those
# landed the same night with their beads closed citing them as verification. The growth
# problem was never that the gate gets longer as features arrive. It is that a new suite is
# written, goes green once in its author's session, and is then run by nothing, forever.
#
# WHY A TIMED RUN AND NOT SELECTION. Selection picks from a registry; these suites were in no
# registry, so no selector would have found them either. Selection is also unsound in the one
# direction that matters until this exists: an unmapped file falls back to "run everything",
# and "everything" was a hand-maintained list already missing five of nine. The full run is
# what makes selection safe later, not the other way round — and the `# covers:` lines the
# selector will want are still on eight of the suites and cost nothing to keep.
#
# DISCOVERY IS A GLOB, NEVER A LIST. `spira/test-*.sh` is the whole population. A list is the
# thing that just failed, so a new suite is run by existing to be found, and a deleted one
# stops being run with no edit anywhere. The ONE hand-written list is the gate's, in
# `gate-suites`, and this runs its complement — so a suite dropped from the gate moves here
# rather than out of the world, and neither set can be edited into overlapping the other.
#
# A SUITE WITH NO `# covers:` LINE IS STILL RUN. The annotation is for selection, which is a
# later bead; a missing one is reported as an omission and never as a reason to skip. Skipping
# it would reproduce this defect exactly, in a mechanism written to end it.
#
# IT DOES NOT REOPEN, BLOCK OR POISON ANYTHING. A red files a bead and nothing more. By
# law-reversibility-outranks-coverage a failure caught twenty minutes after landing is fine
# when a revert undoes it, and a timed runner that could refuse work would be the seventeen
# minutes back on the critical path under a different name.
#
# WHERE IT RUNS: inside the Ops session, which is why there is no timer unit for it. The
# watchtower NAMES this scan on the sweep it files and Ops runs it. That division is not
# decoration — the watchtower's whole contract is to be deterministic and cheap, because the
# one thing a detector may not be is another thing that is down during an outage, and a
# several-minute test run inside it would make it exactly that.

The pass builds one shared fixture and resets it for each borrower (testdb_reset inside
testdb_up). When the reset fails, the borrower exits with the fixture-fault code
(TESTDB_FAULT_EXIT=75) so the pass can file one bead here rather than one per borrower.

Investigate: why did testdb_reset fail? Likely causes: the fixture baseline directory was
deleted mid-pass, the fixture directory was removed, or a concurrent process corrupted it.

    # SHARED TESTDB FIXTURE. Build once; suites that call testdb_up get the fast reset
    # path (~6ms via directory swap) rather than each building their own fresh database
    # (~7s). Without this, 56+ non-gated suites each pay the init cost every pass —
    # over 6 minutes of a 7-minute budget, and the last suites in the rotation are
    # cut short or killed. A suite killed mid-run by a tight slice fires its EXIT trap
    # (rm -rf its temp dir), which cascades failures in subsequent assertions.
    #
    # Vars are exported so every setsid'd suite subprocess inherits them. suites.sh's
    # own SPIRA_DB and PATH are restored immediately after the build so incident.sh and
    # bd calls here continue to reach the production store.
    #
    # BORROWERS DO NOT DROP. testdb_drop inside each suite's EXIT trap is a no-op when
    # TESTDB_SHARED=1 — only this shell drops at the end of cmd_run.
    # testdb_reset inside testdb_up clears the fixture to a clean baseline at the top
    # of every suite's testdb_up call, so each suite starts with an empty store.
    #
    # SPIRA_SUITES_SKIP_TESTDB=1 bypasses this block entirely. The embedded check runs
    # bd init in a temp dir to probe availability (~6s per call), and testdb_up runs a
    # second bd init for the fixture itself (~6s). A test harness that calls suites.sh
    # repeatedly with fixture suites that do not use testdb would pay ~12s per call for
    # a fixture nobody borrows. Set this flag in that context to skip the build; fixture
    # suites that need testdb must build their own.
