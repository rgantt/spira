# test-strand-deferred.sh — the deferred-unescalated check exempts beads whose blocking
#   deps include an open or in-progress bead, and fires for beads with all blockers closed.
#
#   ./test-strand-deferred.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-hg8q: the check escalated deferred beads gated behind a live blocking
# edge — beads that are doing exactly what the DAG requires. The false positive landed on the
# operator's pane as a P1 decision with a default that would undo correct sequencing. The fix:
# skip a deferred bead when at least one of its "blocks" deps is open or in_progress; escalate
# when all known blockers are closed or absent.
#
# FIVE CASES, ALL SIDES EXERCISED (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. LIVE BLOCKER (in_progress dep) — NOT escalated.
#      Without this half, a classifier that never fires looks correct.
#
#   2. DEAD BLOCKER (all deps closed) — IS escalated.
#      Without this half, a classifier that always exempts looks correct.
#
#   3. NO BLOCKERS (no deps) — IS escalated.
#      A deferred bead with no reason is the original defect this check exists for.
#
#   4. MIXED BLOCKERS (one live + one closed) — NOT escalated.
#      One live blocker is sufficient; closed ones do not revoke the exemption.
#
#   5. ASK-LABELLED (carries ask label) — NOT escalated regardless of blockers.
#      Already in the operator's queue; double-reporting adds noise.
#
# EXERCISED VIA FIXTURE FILES, not a live database. strand-classify.py reads BEADS_FILE and
# READY_FILE; the classifier is what is under test, and the DB-to-JSON representation is a
# separate seam verified by test-check2-reclaim / test-check5-drop.
