#
#   ./test-aeon-verdict.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES. Two checks ask the same question — "this bead says closed; is
# there a commit that names it?" — one in aeon.sh at the end of a session, one in the
# sentinel's closed-but-not-landed sweep. Both must exempt a bead retired with `bd
# supersede`, because such a bead will NEVER have a commit naming it: its work was carried
# onto the successor's branch and landed under the successor's id. The exemption was added
# to the sentinel and not to aeon.sh, so a superseded bead was reopened the moment the
# session that retired it exited, re-summoned, re-cut its branch, and spent a whole Opus
# session rediscovering that it was a duplicate — seven times over on one bead before
# anybody read the second check.
#
# EVERY CASE IS A PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The exemption is only
# meaningful if the check it exempts is shown to fire: the superseded bead is asserted to
# survive beside an identical one that is NOT superseded and is reopened, and beside one
# that committed and is therefore left alone for the other reason. A suite that only
# asserted "still closed" would pass just as well against a check that never runs.
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh against a real bd on a throwaway fixture, with a shim
# standing in for the model, because what is under test is a query's shape and a branch's
# commit graph and a model of either would be a second implementation of the thing in
# question (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
