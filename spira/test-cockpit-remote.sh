# test-cockpit-remote.sh — verify that the cockpit/remote/ scripts ship cleanly.
#
# TWO PROPERTIES THIS SUITE EXISTS TO ENFORCE:
#
#   1. COCKPIT_HOST REFUSES, NOT DEFAULTS. The dialer (cockpit/remote/cockpit) has no
#      default for COCKPIT_HOST — a wrong default silently dials somebody else's box,
#      the same shape as SPIRA_ALERT_GLOB. An unset COCKPIT_HOST must exit non-zero
#      with a message naming the variable. This suite is the proof that "the default is
#      gone" does not mean "the guard is silent about it".
#
#   2. INVENTORY IS CLEAN. Both files are tracked here; inventory.sh must pass them.
#      The positive control: if we introduce a forbidden path, inventory.sh must
#      catch it. Without the positive control a silent grep reports clean even when
#      pointed at the wrong directory.
