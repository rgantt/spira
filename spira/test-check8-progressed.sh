# test-check8-progressed.sh — CHECK 8 fires when acted > 0 but progressed == 0;
#   does NOT fire when progressed > 0.
#
#   ./test-check8-progressed.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Before sp-acted-conflation, sentinel.sh kept a single `acted` counter
# and gated CHECK 8 (judgement/inference) on `acted == 0`. Any false positive from any
# earlier check — the reclaim probe matching its own idle message, the Sending failing to
# delete a locked branch — incremented `acted` and silenced the one check that notices
# the system is stuck.
#
# The fix splits the counter: `acted` records any write; `progressed` records only a real
# DAG movement (a bead changed status, a branch landed). CHECK 8 gates on `progressed == 0`,
# never on `acted == 0`.
#
# TWO CASES, BOTH SIDES EXERCISED:
#   1. ACTED-WITHOUT-PROGRESS — the Sending emits a SENT line (→ act() called, progressed
#      stays 0). CHECK 8 must fire. Without this half, a regression that gates CHECK 8 on
#      acted == 0 again is indistinguishable from the correct code.
#
#   2. POSITIVE CONTROL (progressed > 0) — a line in the landing mailbox causes land_drain
#      to call progress(), but the harness is otherwise starved. CHECK 8 must NOT fire.
#      Without this half, a check-8 that always fires would pass case 1 for the wrong reason.
#
# FIXTURE. A goal epic with one open child bead carrying the ask label. The ask label
# excludes it from plan_ready (ready_count strips it), so plan_ready=0, plan_inprog=0 and
# n_open=1 on every pass — the starved state that should reach CHECK 8 each time. No
# blocking dep is needed; the label exclusion is cheaper and just as reliable.
#
# A REAL bd ON A FIXTURE DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). plan_ready and
# plan_inprog are read from bd; a stub would drift silently and prove nothing about the
# path that mattered.
