#   ./test-auron.sh
#
# THE NEGATIVE CASES CARRY THE WEIGHT HERE, more than in any other suite. Auron's whole
# job is to be believed, and the expensive failure is not a missed stall — the loop is
# watched by a human too — but a false one, because a watchdog that cries during ordinary
# operation gets scrolled past, and then the one real alert lands in a pane that has been
# taught to ignore it (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).
#
# So two of the cases below are REPLAYS OF REAL SENTINEL LOG, committed under testdata/:
#
#   sentinel-healthy.log     ~90 real passes over three hours of ordinary operation.
#                            Nothing may fire over it. This is the noise floor, measured
#                            rather than asserted.
#   sentinel-pre-check7.log  real passes from before CHECK 7 logged its declines. The
#                            FIRST version of the starvation rule — "the pass logged no
#                            CHECK7 line, so it never reached the summon check" — fired on
#                            76 consecutive passes here, every one of them healthy: their
#                            silence was a fact about the sentinel's vocabulary at the
#                            time, not about its behaviour. The rule now reads `aeons=0`
#                            off the state line instead, and this fixture is what keeps it
#                            from regressing to an inference about an absent line.
#
# THE SKIP RULE. The classifier half needs nothing but python and runs everywhere. The
# reconcile half drives a real `bd` against a throwaway Dolt database, because a stub for
# bd has twice made correct callers look broken (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). With no
# server, this suite exits 77 — the automake skip convention, which gate-brain.sh names in
# the gate's output — but ONLY if everything that did run passed. A skip must never be able
# to swallow a failure.
