#
# THE DEFECT. A report about an unclaimable bead is filed into the incident partition. When
# that partition is unservable — a narrowed roster, a missing persona — the report is itself
# unclaimable, so the detector reports it, and that report is unclaimable too. The dedup key
# is unclaimable:<subject>, and every link is a NEW subject, so dedup never fires.
#
# Measured 2026-09-12: one watchtower incident seeded a 128-deep chain and took the store from
# 58 beads to 310 in minutes during a single-persona focus period. Nothing was wrong except
# the missing base case — the detector was correctly reporting a condition it was itself
# creating more of.
#
# CASE 1 IS THE POSITIVE CONTROL and matters as much as the guard: a genuinely unclaimable
# bead must still be reported. A detector that reports nothing passes every other case here.
#
# covers: spira/lib.sh (detect_unclaimable_ready)
# hermetic-ok: drives the detector's own python body against fixture JSON; no database,
# hermetic-ok: no systemd, no network
# timeout: 60
