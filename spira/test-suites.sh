# test-suites.sh — every suite in the tree is run by something, and a red reaches a bead.
#
#   ./test-suites.sh
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS. A suite that nothing runs is not a cheap test; it is a false record of
# coverage, and worse than no suite at all, because its existence is what stops anybody
# writing the check it was meant to be. Measured once: nine suites in the tree, four named by
# the landing gate, FIVE run by nothing, three of them landed the same night with their beads
# closed citing them as verification. The runner under test is the answer to that, and its own
# failure mode is identical in shape — it can quietly run a subset, file nothing, or record a
# green it never obtained, and every one of those looks exactly like a healthy pass.
#
# SO EVERY ABSENCE HERE IS PROVED THROUGH A PRESENCE (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
# before believing that a gated suite is not run, an ungated one is proved to be run by the
# same pass; before believing that a repeated red files no second bead, a CHANGED red is
# proved to file one; before believing a missing record means "never ran", a record is read
# off a suite that did.
#
# THE PLANTED SUITES ARE THE POINT. Nothing here names a real suite, because the property
# under test is that the runner needs no list: a suite is run BY EXISTING, so the fixture
# creates files and expects them to be picked up, and deletes one and expects it to stop. A
# fixture naming the tree's real suites would be asserting against today's tree.
#
# THE INTAKE IS THE REAL ONE, on a throwaway database (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). The
# dedupe under test is incident.sh's dedupe on the external ref, and a stub would reproduce
# whichever half of it the author remembered — which is how a partial model of `bd` twice made
# correct callers look broken here.
#
# EVERY CONFIGURED VALUE IS PINNED TO A NON-DEFAULT and the program runs under `env -i`
# (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment). Asserting against the shipped budget or the shipped
# priority passes just as well with the number written back into the code, which is the thing
# the key exists to stop.

# is borrowed from the box is one line long and visible rather than ambient.

# THE DEFECT THIS PINS. cmd_run used out="$(timeout ... bash $s 2>&1)". Command substitution
# reads until EOF ON THE PIPE, not until the child exits, so a suite that backgrounds anything
# inheriting stdout keeps the write end open after the suite itself has finished — and the
# runner blocks on a suite that already SUCCEEDED. timeout kills the script and never touches
# an orphaned grandchild, so the wall does not rescue it either.
#
# Measured before the fix: test-aeon-heartbeat.sh passes 22/0 standalone, yet the hourly pass
# recorded no result for it and none for the three suites alphabetically after it. Killing
# exactly the two orphaned `sleep` pids released a wedged reader within 2 seconds.
#
# 16031d8 fixed it by redirecting to a file and reading the file. It landed WITHOUT a test,
# which is why this exists: the failure is silent, it looks exactly like a slow suite, and the
# next leak would reproduce it with nothing to say so.
#
# THE SECOND SUITE IS THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS. A leaker that merely takes its own timeout
# costs one result; a leaker that wedges the RUNNER costs every suite after it, which is the
# shape actually observed. So plant a name that sorts after the leaker and require its record.
