# test-check5-drop.sh — CHECK 5's exemptions actually exempt, and its reopen still fires.
#
#   ./test-check5-drop.sh
#
# THE THREE CASES, each a pair (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. A closed bead with `spira-dropped` is NOT reopened — it was dropped by the operator.
#   2. A closed bead that has been superseded is NOT reopened — its work lands under the
#      successor's name.
#   3. An ordinary closed bead with no commit naming it IS reopened — that is the whole point
#      of CHECK 5 and without this control the exemptions are indistinguishable from a check
#      that never fires at all.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. The supersession exemption shipped broken and never once fired:
# `bd list` returns {"type"} where `bd show` returns {"dependency_type"}, so `sup` was 0
# for every bead and sp-dvlq was reopened every two minutes while carrying the dependency.
# The drop exemption (spira-dropped, 3828725) reads a label off the same bulk query and has
# the same shape of risk: an untested exemption on a data path that has already been wrong
# once.
#
# A REAL bd ON A FIXTURE DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency), because what is under
# test is how `bd list --status closed` represents labels and dependencies — precisely the
# seam that broke supersession.
