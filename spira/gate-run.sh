# gate-run.sh — run the landing gate so that no single foreground call can outlive the
# ceiling an agent's tool puts on one command.
#
#   gate-run.sh <branch> [repo-name]      start it if nothing is running, then wait up to
#                                         SPIRA_GATE_POLL seconds and report
#   gate-run.sh --status <branch> [repo]  answer now, waiting for nothing
#   gate-run.sh --exec   <branch> [repo]  the detached run itself; not for hand use
#
# Exit codes, and they are the interface:
#
#   0  the gate passed              1  the gate failed, or could not be run
#   2  still deciding — call the same command again
#   3  (--status only) no gate is running for that branch and none has finished
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. An agent's Bash tool moves a foreground command to the background at a
# fixed ceiling and hands the session back a task id. The gate outgrew that ceiling, so the
# aeon that ran it never saw a verdict: it ended its turn to wait, ending its turn ended the
# session, and the bead was released in_progress WITH AN ATTEMPT CHARGED for a race it did
# not lose. A fresh aeon was then summoned onto the same bead to run the same long gate
# again. No `timeout` the caller chooses can move that ceiling, because the ceiling is the
# tool's and fires first.
#
# So the wait is split. The gate runs detached, writing its output and then its exit code to
# a state directory; every call here waits a BOUNDED slice of it and returns something the
# caller can act on. Three short calls beat one that is silently truncated, and the caller
# always holds either a verdict or the knowledge that there is not one yet.
#
# THE VERDICT IS KEYED TO WHAT WAS JUDGED — the branch's commit and the ref it lands on,
# both resolved to object ids. A cached pass belongs to that pair and to nothing else: a
# rebase, a new commit, or the base moving underneath all produce a different pair and start
# a new run. Without that the second call after a rebase would hand back the verdict for the
# tree before it, which is the failure this whole file is downstream of — a check answering
# confidently about the wrong thing.
#
# IT FAILS CLOSED, everywhere it can be uncertain. A run whose process is gone without
# having recorded an exit code is reported as a failure, not as a pass and not as "still
# running": those are the two readings that would let unverified work land, and a gate that
# reports its own collapse as all-clear is worse than no gate
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
