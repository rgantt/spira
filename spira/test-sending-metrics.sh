#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# The ops pane rendered "184 fiends — unsent work that came back" while the true number was
# TWO: sp-gate-rebuild, which git refused to delete on 89 consecutive passes, and
# sp-supersede-key on 4. The operator read it beside "3 awaiting rites" and reasonably
# concluded there was a large backlog of dead work. There was none.
#
# Two defects produced that number, and this suite exists because neither was detectable from
# the outside — both render as a plausible integer, and a plausible integer is exactly what a
# broken counter looks like (law-alerts-must-be-actionable: a false alert spends attention,
# and the next true one is not believed).
#
#   1. LINES, NOT BRANCHES. The sending runs every two minutes, so one branch it cannot
#      delete scores ~720 a day. The identical bug was found and fixed for held/kept — "the
#      pane read 'held 221' for 23 distinct branches" — and sent/failed were left as bare
#      counters directly beneath the comment recording it.
#
#   2. ONE EVENT COUNTED TWICE. The predicate matched both sending.sh's per-branch
#      `FAILED <id>` and sentinel.sh's per-pass summary "sending reported a branch it could
#      not delete", which is emitted only when the former is already present in the same
#      captured output. 93 refusals rendered as 186.
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST IS A DISTINCTION, NOT A VALUE. A suite asserting only "failed == 2"
# on a fixture with two failures passes just as well against a line-counter if the fixture
# happens to have one line each. So every fixture here repeats its events across many passes,
# which is the shape the real log has and the only shape that can tell the two implementations
# apart. That is law-absence-needs-a-positive-control in its positive form: prove the counter
# CAN see a second distinct branch, in the same fixture where it must not see a second copy of
# the first.
#
# NO DATABASE, NO BOX. sending_metrics is a pure function over log lines, so the fixture is a
# string and the suite is hermetic by construction.
