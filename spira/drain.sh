# database, agents that are genuinely alive, and PRs still in flight. law-freeze-gastown-

# that does not drain is a stall wearing a freeze's clothes.
#
# LIVENESS IS `gt agents`, NEVER `gt polecat list` or `gt rig status` — those count
# DIRECTORIES, so a reaped rig still reports its polecats. And `gt` reports an empty town
