# test-gate-fixture-diag.sh — gate's error output includes fixture-build diagnostic,
# not just the generic "could not build" message.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS. A gate suite that fails to build its fixture emits two
# pieces of output: the actual reason from the builder (written to stderr), and then
# the generic "could not build a fixture database" echo. When the gate ran further
# suites after the failure, their one-line "ok" entries pushed the builder diagnostic
# past the output window gate.sh applied with `| tail -20`, leaving only the later
# lines. The operator read the gate's error message and saw passing suites, not the
# fixture build failure that caused the red. The fix removes the truncation: the gate
# command's full output passes through, and the diagnostic is present wherever in the
# run it occurs.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL. A check that reports "diagnostic present" without
# first confirming the diagnostic COULD have been absent proves nothing. Case 2 below
# verifies that the offender (the diagnostic token) is correctly identified, then Case
# 1 verifies it survives a run where tail -20 would have lost it.
