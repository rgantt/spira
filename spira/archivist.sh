# archivist.sh — rescue a full session's unfinished business before it is thrown away.
#
#   archivist.sh sweep            every live session; archive the ones that have drifted
#   archivist.sh now [<session>]  archive one session now, whatever its context (the manual
#                                 path — "hibernate", before a deliberate clear)
#   archivist.sh list             what the sweep can see, and what it would do about each
#   archivist.sh mark <s> <state> [<n>]   the running archivist's own progress writes
#   archivist.sh state [<s>]      print what the status line and the dashboard are reading
#   archivist.sh digest <t> [<from-turn>] [--full]
#                                 the transcript rendered small enough for an agent to read
#
# WHAT PROBLEM THIS IS. Context is re-read in full on every turn, so a long session costs many
# times a fresh one for identical work, and the fix — clearing — is exactly what nobody dares
# do, because a session near the ceiling is also the session carrying the most that was never
# written down: questions asked and never answered, findings stated and never filed, verdicts
# acted on and never recorded. So the expensive state is also the sticky one. This makes
# clearing cheap by making the loss impossible.
#
# IT READS THE TRANSCRIPT, NOT THE CONVERSATION. Everything it needs is already on disk: every
# turn, every tool result, every verdict. So it costs the session it is rescuing exactly
# nothing — no turn, no tokens, no interruption. That is not an optimisation, it is the design
# constraint: a persistence step that itself adds turns makes the problem it exists to solve
# slightly worse every time it runs, and would be worst in the sessions that need it most.
#
# WHY THE ARCHIVIST IS NOT A FAYTH, and this was the open question when this was designed. An
# aeon's subject is a BEAD: it claims one under a lease, cuts a branch, commits, and is judged
# by whether a commit names the bead. The archivist's subject is a TRANSCRIPT. Giving it a bead
# per session would mean the machinery for rescuing unfinished business itself manufactured one
# unfinished bead per session — and none of the apparatus buys anything here, because it writes
# beads and wiki notes rather than code, so there is no branch, no landing gate and nothing to
# rebase. The watcher therefore invokes it directly, and the state file below is what stands in
# for a lease: it is the record that a sweep happened, how far it got, and when.
#
# WHERE THE WATCHER LIVES, and this was the other open question: its own timer, not a sentinel
# check. The sentinel returns the moment the bead graph is healthy — which is exactly when a
# session at the keyboard is most likely to be quietly filling up — so a check hung off the end
# of a pass would miss the common case entirely. Its subject is orthogonal to the bead graph,
# and its cadence is different: a lease dies in minutes, a session crosses a band over tens of
# them.
#
# CONCURRENCY IS CAPPED AT ONE ARCHIVE AT A TIME, across both entry points, by a single
# archivist-wide lock. Type=oneshot plus the timer's refusal to restart an active unit means
# one sweep cannot overlap the next, but a manual `now <session>` is outside both mechanisms
# by construction — the per-session lock only prevents two callers archiving the SAME session.
# The archivist-wide lock is what prevents two callers archiving DIFFERENT sessions at once:
# the sweep skips a session it cannot lock and moves on; the manual path waits, because an
# operator told "busy, try later" will simply run it again in a loop.

# ---- the state file, which is a contract with two readers ------------------------------
# ctx-meter.sh renders it in the status line and cockpit/health.sh renders it on the
# dashboard, both from $SPIRA_RUN/archivist/<session>.state as flat key=value lines:
#
#   state=sweeping|archiving|safe|failed|capacity
#   at_turn=<the session's turn count when this state was computed>
#   items_filed=<how many beads and notes were written>
#
# AT_TURN IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT BOOKKEEPING. "Safe to clear" is a statement about the session as
# it was when the sweep read it; forty turns later it describes a session that no longer exists,
# and acting on it discards everything said since. Both readers demote a stale verdict to "safe
# as of N turns ago" on exactly this number. A state written without it would have the meter
# telling the operator it is safe to discard work the archivist never saw.
#
# AND IT IS WRITTEN AS THE WORK HAPPENS, never only at the end. A long sweep that shows nothing
# is indistinguishable from an archivist that never ran, which is the state the operator is
# trying to escape.
# The exit code `archive` uses to say "the account refused this, and will refuse the next one
# too". Out of the way of a real failure's own code, and named so the two call sites cannot
# drift from the site that raises it.

# ---- which transcripts are a live session at the keyboard -------------------------------

#
#   too old       Everything this rescues is rescued so the session can be cleared, which only
#                 matters while somebody is still in it. A transcript untouched for longer than
#                 SPIRA_ARCHIVIST_IDLE is history, and sweeping the whole disk on every pass is
#                 the unbounded fan-out this kind of box has a load-274 scar from
#                 (law-fence-loops-on-shared-hardware).
#
#   the harness's own   An aeon's unfinished business is its BEAD — that is the entire point of
#                 a lease and a reaper — so archiving an aeon's transcript files a second,
#                 worse copy of work the graph already tracks. The archivist's own session is
#                 excluded by the same rule, and must be: it runs with its working directory
#                 inside $SPIRA_RUN precisely so that it is, and without that the sweep would
#                 eventually archive the archivist.
#
#   empty         A session that has not spoken has nothing to rescue.
#
# The exclusion is derived from $SPIRA_RUN rather than written out, because the client's
# project directory is the working directory with every non-alphanumeric character replaced by
# a hyphen — so any path under the runtime directory has that directory's slug as a prefix. A
