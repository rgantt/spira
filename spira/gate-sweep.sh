# gate-sweep.sh — remove stale gate worktree registrations from a repository.
#
#   gate-sweep.sh <repo-path> [max-age-seconds]
#
# A gate worktree is stale when its path is under /tmp (the old default; $SPIRA_RUN is now
# preferred) OR when it is older than max-age-seconds and named .gate.<repo-basename>.
#
# Safe to run while gate.sh is running: the gate holds the worktree's lockfile, and the
# sweep skips any worktree whose lock it cannot immediately take — meaning an active gate
# is never interrupted.
#
# Called automatically from gate.sh before the flock, and safe to invoke by hand to clean
# up worktrees accumulated before gate.sh grew its own cleanup trap.
#
# ONLY TARGETS .gate.<repo-basename> WORKTREES. Other registrations — aeon worktrees, the
# main checkout, session scratchpads — are left alone. Non-gate orphans accumulated before
# this script existed must be removed by hand.
