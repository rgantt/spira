#   ./test-check4-events.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. Counter labels (sp-attempt-N, sp-reclaim-N, sp-requeue-N,
# sp-timeout-N, sp-recur-N) polluted the label bag: 195 of 660 distinct labels in the old
# store were counter labels, sp-reclaim alone having 96 forms because it encoded a cause
# suffix. Labels carry no validation, so each form was a new string that could disagree with
# the events trail.
#
# The new design is simpler: an attempt is a status_changed event whose new_value contains
# 'in_progress'. The events table is always populated by bd and cannot disagree with itself.
# The poison decision reads it on demand, never stores it.
#
# THREE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, ALL TESTED HERE:
# 1. No counter label (sp-attempt-*, sp-reclaim-*, sp-requeue-*, sp-timeout-*, sp-recur-*) is
#    written by any harness path — asserted structurally on the code.
# 2. A bead cycled N times reports exactly N; unclaimed rows carrying the string do not
#    over-count — asserted against a real database with known event counts.
# 3. The poison decision uses the events predicate — asserted via sentinel.sh CHECK4.
#
# FAIL-FIRST for criteria 2 and 3: each assertion below is run against the unfixed code first
# (where attempts_of reads labels), confirmed to fail, then run against the fixed code.
#
# A REAL bd ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE. The events are written by bd itself; a stub would be a
# second implementation of exactly the thing being asked about
# (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
