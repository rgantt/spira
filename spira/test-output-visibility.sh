# test-output-visibility.sh — a suite that exits non-zero must produce combined output;
# silent failure (no stdout/stderr) leaves the filed bead body empty and the failure
# undiagnosable. suites.sh detects empty output on a failure path and annotates it.
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS. The timed runner filed beads for failing suites that had redirected
# all their output away from stdout/stderr — the bead body was empty, containing no
# context for whoever would work the bead. The runner now detects a suite that exits
# non-zero with no combined output and appends a sentinel so the bead body is never
# empty on a failure path.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL IS FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Before trusting
# that the guard fires, the offender suite is run bare and confirmed to produce no
# output — establishing that the guard is needed, not already satisfied by the suite
# itself.
#
# THE INTAKE IS THE REAL ONE on a throwaway database (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
#
# EVERY CONFIGURED VALUE IS PINNED TO A NON-DEFAULT (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
