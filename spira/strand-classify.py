strand-classify.py — the classifier behind strand.sh: partition state in, stranded rows out.

Split out of strand.sh so it can be run against fixtures. Every kind below is a distinct
failure mode with a distinct fix, which is the whole complaint against `gt convoy stranded`:
it collapsed three unrelated conditions into one list and named no action for any of them.

  ghost                in_progress, lease expired, and no live aeon holds it
  deferred-unescalated deferred with no escalation label — the state the statute forbids
  starved              claimable work exists and nothing alive is working it
  stale-blocked        every blocker closed, nothing claimable — is_blocked went stale
  blocked-external     blocked by a bead outside the partition; no aeon can ever clear it
  stuck                blocked by work that is itself not moving
  cycle                a dependency ring: permanently unclaimable
  empty                an open epic with no children
  waiting / poisoned   informational: already in the operator's queue, never escalated again

Input is environment, so this composes with shell: BEADS and READY are `bd ... --json`
payloads, HOLDERS is "<bead-id>\t0|1" lines from the /proc liveness check, LIVE is the
number of running aeons, GHOST_GRACE the lease grace window in seconds.

THE TWO PAYLOADS COME AS FILES, named in BEADS_FILE and READY_FILE. The inline form is kept
for fixtures small enough to write by hand, and it is the form that failed in production:
the kernel caps ONE argv or environment string at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (128 KiB, independent of
ARG_MAX), and a partition of a few hundred beads is several times that. execve then refuses
the classifier outright, every pass, and the sentinel's other lines look ordinary while the
stranded-work check produces nothing.

Output is TSV: kind, id, disposition (act|escalate|info), detail, action.
