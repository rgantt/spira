# test-aeon-resume.sh — when a branch carries prior commits, aeon.sh includes a RESUME_BRIEF
# in the model's prompt so it resumes the existing work rather than restarting from scratch.
#
#   ./test-aeon-resume.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES. When a bead is closed and its branch fails the landing gate,
# the sentinel reopens the bead and summons a new aeon. That aeon inherits the branch with
# its prior commits, but the prompt contained no mention of those commits — so the model
# re-implemented the work from scratch, paid the full session cost again, and closed a bead
# that was already done. sp-2e4v measured 16 such beads in one day, $49 of $491 spent.
#
# The fix: aeon.sh computes the commit count (BASE..BRANCH) AFTER rebasing, and when it is
# non-zero, inserts a RESUME_BRIEF section naming those commits. Zero commits (fresh branch)
# gets no brief.
#
# EVERY CASE IS A PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control): the fresh-branch case must
# show the brief is ABSENT, beside the prior-commits case that shows it is PRESENT, so the
# test is not vacuously passing against a RESUME_BRIEF written unconditionally.
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh against a real bd, with a shim for the model that captures
# the prompt, because the assertion is about what text reaches the model and a mock of
# aeon.sh would test the mock (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
#
