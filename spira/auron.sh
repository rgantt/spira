# auron.sh — the watchdog over the loop. Its only power is speech.
#
#   auron.sh            one pass (this is what the timer runs)
#   auron.sh --report   classify and print, write nothing
#
# (per the operator, 2026-09-06: "a true livelock situation needs a higher-level sentinel
# whose responsibility is ONLY to escalate the situation.")
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. law-file-it-and-let-the-loop-fix-it says a harness defect is filed and
# fixed by the loop, never by hand — including a fault that stops the loop. That is only
# honest if something notices the loop has stopped and says so. Without this, the statute's
# one hard case resolves to silence.
#
# THE SOLE POWER IS SPEECH, AND THE RESTRICTION IS THE DESIGN. It escalates. It does not
# repair, restart, reclaim, land, kill or summon anything, and it must not grow the ability
# to. A watchdog that can act is a second controller with no supervisor of its own, and the
# first thing it will do wrong is fight the sentinel over the same resource. Auron in FFX is
# the guardian who tells the truth about the pilgrimage and never walks it in the pilgrim's
# place; the name is the reminder.
#
# IT MUST NOT BE ABLE TO LIVELOCK, and that constraint dictates everything below. No
# inference. No git. No worktrees, no repo checkouts, no gate, no test run, no fetch. It
# reads timestamps and counters out of files, asks the database one question, and compares
# what it found to thresholds. Every external call carries a short timeout, and the unit
# carries a RuntimeMaxSec: a pass that cannot finish is killed, and a killed pass stops
# writing the heartbeat, which is the one symptom that must never be silent.
#
# ITS OWN DEATH IS VISIBLE, BY CONSTRUCTION. A silent escalator and a healthy system look
# identical, and the pane would render the healthy reading, which is the failure
# law-absence-needs-a-positive-control is named for. So the heartbeat is written on EVERY
# run including a failing one, and the ops pane shows its age and marks it stale rather
# than omitting it (cockpit.sh SP_AURON_*, health.sh).
#
# WHERE THE ALERT GOES, AND IN WHICH ORDER
# ----------------------------------------
# (corrected per the operator, 2026-09-06: "auron should write to beads — a dolt issue is
# not the only thing that could cause a livelock. if necessary, it may also write to a
# special sentinel file ... but that should be secondary.")
#
#   1. BEADS IS THE RECORD. An alert is one bead per CAUSE, type `event`, labelled
#      `alert`, `overseer` and `alert:<key>`. It gets identity, status, a description that
#      is regenerated whole, and a lifecycle the attention pane can read.
#   2. THE FALLBACK FILE IS SECONDARY, written if and only if the beads path failed —
#      which is exactly the case where beads itself is the casualty. Its EXISTENCE is
#      therefore meaningful: it says the database could not be reached. It is removed the
#      moment beads answers again, so there is never a second source of truth standing
#      beside a working first one.
#
# An earlier draft had this backwards, reasoning from one failure mode (Dolt down) and
# making the rare case the default path — which would have put every ordinary alert
# through a channel with no history, no id and no lifecycle. Most livelocks (a wedged
# pass, summon starvation, an unreclaimed lease) leave the database perfectly healthy.
#
# NOT `needs-ryan`, DELIBERATELY, for two reasons. That label means a decision only the
# operator can make and is excluded from every fayth's predicate; an alert is a CONDITION,
# not a decision. And brain-guard requires a needs-ryan bead to be closed through
# resolve.sh, which would stop Auron clearing its own alert when the condition passes.
#
# THE LABELS ARE A CONTRACT WITH THE ATTENTION PANE, not decoration. The ALERTS tab selects
# on `alert` AND `overseer`, reads the flap count out of `flaps:<n>`, and owns two labels
# this program must respect rather than write:
#
#   acked          the operator has SEEN it. It says nothing about the condition, which is
#                  why an acked alert stays on the tab. Auron removes it when the condition
#                  RETURNS, because a fresh occurrence is not one anybody has looked at.
#   silent-until:  hidden until an instant carried in the label itself, so the silence
#                  expires with no process running. Auron never writes it and never removes
#                  it: it is the pane's affordance and fighting over it would make a
#                  silence the operator asked for evaporate on the next pass.
#
# Nothing in the pane may CLOSE an alert — retracting the statement belongs to whatever
# asserted it — but a close from a terminal is still possible, and is handled below as an
# acknowledgement rather than argued with.
#
# AURON CLOSES ITS OWN ALERTS. That is still only speech — retracting a statement, not
# acting on the system — and it is what makes the tab self-clearing. It does NOT reopen an
# alert the operator closed by hand while the condition still holds: that close is an
# acknowledgement, and re-raising it would be a machine arguing with a human.
#
# NOISE IS THE FAILURE MODE. A watchdog that cries during every ordinary long landing gets
# ignored, and then it is worse than nothing (law-alerts-must-be-actionable). Three
# defences, in order of how much they matter: thresholds measured from the real pass log
# rather than guessed (see auron-classify.py for the numbers); a condition must hold for
# CONFIRM consecutive runs before it fires, and clear for CLEAR consecutive runs before it
# is retracted, so nothing flaps on one sample; and one bead per cause forever, reopened
# and flap-counted, because ten beads for one cause is how a pane becomes wallpaper.

Cleared by Auron: the condition stopped holding for $CLEAR consecutive checks.
Raised $(iso "${S_FIRST[$k]:-$NOW}"), fired ${S_FLAPS[$k]:-1} time(s).
Nothing was repaired by Auron — it only reports. Either the loop recovered on its own
or something else fixed it.
