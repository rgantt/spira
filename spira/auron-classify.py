"""auron-classify.py — Auron's whole judgement, as a pure function of observations.

    auron.sh gathers -> this classifies -> auron.sh speaks

Reads ONE json object on stdin and writes zero or more alert objects, one json per
line, to stdout: {"key", "title", "evidence"}. It has no clock, opens no file, runs no
command and reaches no network. `now` is handed in, the sentinel log arrives as a
string, and every threshold is a field. That is what makes the rules below testable
against a captured window rather than against a hypothesis.

WHY THIS IS SPLIT OUT AT ALL. A watchdog nobody has watched fire is a hypothesis, and
the expensive failure here is not a missed stall but a false one: an alert that cries
during every ordinary long landing gets ignored, and then it is worse than nothing
(law-alerts-must-be-actionable). Split, each rule can be replayed over the real
sentinel log — which is how the two thresholds below were chosen rather than guessed.

THE MEASUREMENTS THE THRESHOLDS COME FROM. 962 real sentinel passes over 33 hours,
read out of the log on 2026-09-06, after landing moved off the pass (sp-gatecost):

  gap between completed passes   p50 124s   p90 137s   p99 161s   max 245s (12h)
                                                                  max 436s (24h, pre-fix)
  passes matching `starved`      2 of 962, in ONE streak of 2

So pass_stale defaults to 600s — 2.4x the worst gap ever seen here, five missed timer
ticks — and starve_passes to 5, against an observed maximum run of 2. The condition
this is aimed at ran for 76 consecutive passes before a human noticed it by eye.

EVERY RULE FAILS QUIET, NEVER LOUD, WITH ONE EXCEPTION. If a rule cannot see enough to
judge — too few passes in the tail, a mirror nothing is configured to write — it says
nothing, because a guess is worse than silence from something whose only power is
speech. The exception is `sentinel-unobservable`: a log that cannot be READ is itself
the alert, because "I could not look" and "all clear" must never render as the same
pixels (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
