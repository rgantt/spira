#
#   ./test-superseded.sh
#
# THE CASE THIS IS WRITTEN FOR (sp-amac). A bead retired with `bd supersede` still has its
# branch in refs/heads/spira/*. That branch is a duplicate by definition — its work landed
# under the successor's id — so it does not rebase onto the base, and the old landing pass
# reopened the retired bead saying it "does not rebase". Discovered on sp-dvlq, which was
# superseded by sp-35pl.
#
# TWO HALVES. The landing fix (skip rather than reopen) is the guard that prevents the false
# alarm. The sending fix (reap) is what makes the branch disappear so the skip is rarely
# needed. Both must hold, and the positive control for each is an identical bead that is NOT
# superseded — because every silence below would pass just as well against a version of the
# fix that skipped every branch, or reaped nothing.
