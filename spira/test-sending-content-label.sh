# test-sending-content-label.sh — the Sending labels a content reap, and ONLY a content reap.
#
#   ./test-sending-content-label.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The write half of sp-796o. CHECK 5 skips a bead carrying `content-landed`,
# and test-content-landed-no-reopen.sh proves that half — but a label nothing ever writes
# makes that exemption dead code, and the loop goes on running while both halves look correct
# in isolation. The first attempt at this fix shipped a read guard that could never match; the
# way to not ship its mirror image is to assert the write.
#
# THE NARROWING IS THE POINT. content_landed is true in two different situations and only one
# of them means the work is on the base:
#
#   * a branch with commits of its own whose diff is already on the base — merging changes
#     nothing because someone else landed the same change. THE LABEL BELONGS HERE.
#   * a branch with no commits at all, which an aeon leaves when it dies before committing.
#     Merging changes nothing because there is nothing to merge. Labelling this would exempt
#     empty work from the one check that catches it, so THE LABEL MUST NOT BE WRITTEN.
#
# That second case is not hypothetical: killing three aeons mid-work on 2026-09-08 left three
# such branches within the minute, and the reflog of one showed a single entry — "Created from
# origin/main".
