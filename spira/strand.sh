# strand.sh — stranded-work detection: work that exists and is not moving, with the reason.
#
#   strand.sh report [--json]   the human view; changes nothing   (what `gt convoy stranded` was)
#   strand.sh check             the timer path: act where the fix is mechanical, escalate once
#                               where it is not
#   strand.sh check --dry-run   classify and print, change nothing
#   strand.sh check --from <f>  classify a saved TSV instead of the live graph
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND THE TWO DEFECTS IT DOES NOT INHERIT
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# `gt convoy stranded`. Its own help calls a convoy stranded when it has ready-but-unassigned
# issues, OR no ready issues at all, OR no issues at all — three unrelated conditions with
# three unrelated fixes, printed as one undifferentiated list. Measured: all six
# convoys were "stranded", every one of them with ready_count 0, and nothing had acted on any
# of them. A list that cannot say WHICH condition it found cannot name an action, and a report
# that names no action becomes wallpaper. Every row here carries a kind and the single command
# that clears it.
#
# The second defect is the one this bead exists for. Gas Town's liveness test is "ready but
# unassigned" — an assignee, which is exactly the proxy that lies. `gt polecat list` counts
# DIRECTORIES; a bead assigned to a polecat that died an hour ago reads as worked. Spira asks
# /proc instead: an aeon writes its pid beside the bead id it claimed, and liveness is that pid
# still being an aeon. Never pgrep -f — the pattern is a substring of the caller's own command
# line, so a check for 'aeon.sh' inside a script that mentions it reports itself alive.
#
# ACT ONCE, THEN ESCALATE — NEVER RETRY FOREVER
# ---------------------------------------------
# A kind whose fix is mechanical (a ghost lease, a stale is_blocked flag) is acted on exactly
# ONCE per episode. If the same strand is still there on the next pass, the action did not work
# and repeating it is noise, so it escalates instead. That bound is what keeps this from
# becoming a loop that reclaims the same bead every two minutes and reports an action it did
# not achieve.
#
# WHY THE EPISODE STATE IS A FILE AND NOT `bd kv`
# -----------------------------------------------
# pilgrimage.sh keeps its completion markers in the beads KV store because "this notice was
# DELIVERED" is a fact about the world that cannot be re-derived. "I first noticed this strand
# at 06:14" can be: it is an observation, recomputed from the graph on every pass, and putting
# it in the store of record would write a Dolt commit into a database mirrored to three
# replicas every time a strand appears or clears.
#
# THE BLIND SPOT, NAMED
# ---------------------
# Run from the sentinel, this cannot detect that the sentinel is dead — a check cannot observe
# the failure of the thing running it. So `starved` reports the harness's own liveness from
# systemd and the log mtime, which is the answer the moment anything ELSE runs this: the
# concierge, the cockpit, or the operator.

# EVERY PARTITION THE CHAMBER DECLARES, NOT ONE NAMED HERE. This defaulted to `spira,plan`
# — the builder's partition standing in for every persona — so stalled work belonging to any
# other persona was never reported as stalled, by a report whose empty output reads as a
# healthy harness. SPIRA_LABELS still narrows this to one partition, which is what a targeted
# report wants and what the fixtures below pin.
SPIRA_LABELS="${SPIRA_LABELS:-}"
# PARKED IS NOT STRANDED. A bead carrying $SPIRA_CI_LABEL has no live aeon on purpose: its
# work is pushed, its review is open, and the CI sweep is watching the run. Without it here
# that reads exactly like abandoned work — open, unclaimed, nothing moving — and gets
# reclaimed or escalated for doing the right thing.
#
# THE EXCLUSION IS UNCONDITIONAL HERE, AND THE PARK IS WHAT EXPIRES. A park in a repository
# with no CI, or one that has outlived the longest plausible run, is not parked but lost —
# and it must be reported rather than excluded from the report that would have found it. The
# sweep strips the label in both cases, so such a bead arrives here already unparked and is
# classified like any other. Ageing the exclusion here as well would be a second predicate
# answering the same question, and two predicates that can disagree is the defect, not the fix.
# A PARTITION'S EXCLUSIONS ARE ITS OWN, read from the persona that works it. Set
# SPIRA_EXCLUDE_LABELS to override every partition at once; EXCLUDE_DEFAULT is what a
# partition whose fayth declares none falls back to.
