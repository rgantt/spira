#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# cockpit.sh now emits two SOP metrics into the snapshot:
#
#   SP_SOP_NEVER_FIRED   SOPs on the shelf with no ledger entry — never exercised.
#   SP_SOP_RECURRED      SOPs applied (check=pass) where held=no in the window — the fix
#                        did not hold.
#
# Both must render `?` when their inputs are unreadable, never 0. The failure mode this
# exists to prevent is a broken probe reading as "no dead-weight SOPs, no recurrences" —
# the all-clear that stops anybody looking (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS A REAL NEGATIVE. Every assertion that a probe returns `?` is
# preceded, in the same fixture, by the same probe returning a real number — so a probe
# that always returns `?` fails the positive half, and a probe that never returns `?`
# fails the negative half. Both halves are required.
#
# A REAL `bd` ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE. The probe reads `bd memories --json` from the
# shelf, and a stub `bd` would not reproduce what the real binary returns under error
# conditions — which is the exact case this suite must assert against. The shelf case
# (broken database) depends on `bd` returning the empty string on failure, which it does,
# and no stub can promise to do the same when the code evolves.
