# released-defects.sh — report released defects over a configurable window.

#   released-defects.sh [--window <days>]
#
# A RELEASED DEFECT is a bug bead (type: bug) with a 'discovered-from' link to
# another bead (the introducing bead), where the introducing bead's commit
# reached the base branch BEFORE the fixing bead's commit. Both commits are
# found by searching commit messages on the base branch for each bead's id.
#
# A defect is CAUGHT (not counted) when the introducing bead has no commit on
# the base branch — it was rejected before it could escape. A defect fixed in
# the same commit as its introduction is not counted (same unit).
#
# To mark that a bug was released from a bead's work:
#   bd link <fix-bead> <introducing-bead> --type discovered-from
#
# OUTPUT: one line per released defect —
#   RELEASED  <fix-bead>  <intro-bead>  <intro-commit>  <fix-commit>
#
# A field that cannot be determined renders ?, never 0 or empty — a probe that
# cannot read a field must not report all-clear (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).
#
# WHAT IS NOT COUNTED:
#   - A caught defect: the introducing bead never reached the base branch
#   - Same unit: both beads name the same commit
#   - A bug bead with no discovered-from link (origin unknown, not tracked)
