# test-repo.sh — doctor.sh refuses a repo-map row with fewer than six columns.
#
#   ./test-repo.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS. repo-map.example's header stated that a check refused
# short rows; no such check existed. The hazard is real: repo_field maps NF<6 rows
# by position so that a five-field row's gate field is read as a formatter, and
# whatever the gate column holds — `origin/main`, a test expression — runs as a
# program in the branch's tree after a rebase and commits the result. The fix is
# refusing to load a short row, not changing how repo_field reads one.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The check fires on a
# five-field fixture row before the wider tree is declared clean. A validator tested
# only against well-formed input proves nothing: it passes just as well when its
# pattern never matches.
#
