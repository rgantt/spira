# test-gate-fixture-contamination.sh — gate-spira.sh refuses to land when the production
# database contains test fixture beads.
#
# THE DEFECT SERIES THIS ENDS. Tests that did not isolate their SPIRA_DB wrote beads
# directly into the production store. The markers are unambiguous: external_ref values
# under "fixture-fault:<name>" where <name> is not a real TESTDB_NAME (which always starts
# with "sptest_"), and bodies of exactly "Test payload". Each represents a test whose
# cleanup trap did not run — the live store carries the leak until it is found by hand.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The gate-spira.sh fixture
# contamination fence reads the configured SPIRA_DB. Before asserting that a clean database
# passes, we plant an offender in the fixture database, require the gate to name it, and
# only then trust its silence after removal.
#
# DISCRIMINATION: the fence must NOT flag legitimate fixture-fault beads filed by suites.sh.
# Real TESTDB_NAMEs are "sptest_<tag>_<epoch>_<pid>"; the test inserts one and verifies
# the gate does not reject it.
#
