# SPIRA_FAYTHS NAMES A PERSONA THAT EXISTS. It used to say `t`, for which there is no
# chamber/t.fayth — harmless only because the partition map globbed chamber/*.fayth and
# ignored SPIRA_FAYTHS altogether. Resolving partitions through fayth_get honours it, so an
# unresolvable persona now yields no partitions, which is a REFUSAL: the probe renders ?
# rather than 0. That is correct behaviour and it would have made this suite assert the
# opposite of what it means, so the fixture names a real persona instead.
#

# POSITIVE CONTROL FIRST. A check that only tests absence is indistinguishable from one
# pointed at the wrong thing; proving it fires on a known input proves the machinery
# works before we rely on its silence (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).

# asks. SP_READY and SP_NEXT_N should be 0, not ?.

# THE DEFECT THIS SUITE NOW GUARDS. The partition map used to be derived by reading each
# .fayth as text and hand-substituting one variable, so every other expansion reached bd
# verbatim: a predicate carrying a scope label became a query for a label literally named
# ${SPIRA_SCOPE_LABEL:+...},plan. bd answered [] truthfully, the refusal guard saw output
# rather than silence, and the pane reported "0 ready" against 32 ready beads.
#
# Two assertions, because the failure had two halves: the map must RESOLVE (no unexpanded
# shell survives into a label), and an UNRESOLVABLE chamber must refuse rather than read as
# an empty queue.
