# test-check5-nopayload.sh — CHECK 5 accepts a close when a bead declares its deliverable
#   via delivers:TYPE labels and the evidence exists; bare closed beads are still reopened.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A bead whose deliverable is not a repository commit — a diagnosis, a set
# of filed beads, a wiki note — cannot carry the commit that CHECK 5 normally looks for. The
# prior answer (no-payload) exempted unconditionally, so a sweep that fell over after its
# first command was indistinguishable from one that filed twenty beads. The typed-and-verified
# form (sp-4z3s) requires the aeon to declare what it produced and CHECK 5 to confirm it is
# present. no-payload is retired by this change: a bead carrying it is now treated as a bare
# closed bead and reopened.
#
# CASES, each asserted (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — a bare closed bead with no commit IS reopened. Without this, every
#      exemption is indistinguishable from a check that never fires.
#
#   2. delivers:beads WITH children — NOT reopened; at least one child bead names it as source.
#
#   3. delivers:beads WITHOUT children — IS reopened; the declared evidence is absent.
#
#   4. delivers:note:PATH with a file written in the bead's window — NOT reopened.
#
#   5. delivers:note:PATH with an old file (predates started_at) — IS reopened.
#
#   6. delivers:note:PATH with a missing file — IS reopened.
#
#   7. no-payload (retired) — IS reopened, same as the bare closed case.
#
#   8. SEAM CHECK — the bulk query carries delivers: labels so the exemption can read them.
#
# A REAL bd ON A FIXTURE DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). The exemption
# reads labels and children off `bd list`; a stub would drift silently.
#
# defect: sp-4z3s
# covers: spira/sentinel.sh spira/lib.sh
