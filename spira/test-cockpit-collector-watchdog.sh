# test-cockpit-collector-watchdog.sh — the staleness watchdog in layout.sh restarts
# the collector when it predates cockpit.sh (SPIRA_PROD), and leaves it alone when
# the source is older than the process.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, each requiring a positive control (a run that does nothing passes
# identically whether the logic is correct or the watchdog is aimed at a dead unit):
#
#   1. STALE COLLECTOR: process started before cockpit.sh was promoted → restart fired.
#      This is the positive control. Without it, a watchdog that never fires is
#      indistinguishable from one that correctly finds nothing to do.
#
#   2. FRESH COLLECTOR: process started after cockpit.sh → no restart (no false positives).
#
#   3. UNIT DISCOVERY: only the instance-qualified unit (spira-cockpit-prod.service) is
#      active; the plain unit (spira-cockpit.service) is inactive. The watchdog finds and
#      uses the active unit. This is the first bug this suite closes: the old code had a
#      literal spira-cockpit.service, which is inactive on every migrated box.
#
# The watchdog function is extracted from layout.sh at runtime — not copied — so the suite
# stays in sync when the function changes.
#
# defect: sp-vjiug
# covers: cockpit/layout.sh
