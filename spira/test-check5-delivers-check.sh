# test-check5-delivers-check.sh — CHECK 5 accepts a close when a bead declares
#   delivers:check:<command> and the command exits 0; reopens when it exits non-zero.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Infrastructure beads — those that clone a checkout, write config,
# install units — produce no commit, no child bead, and no file the bead authored. The
# existing delivers: types (beads, note, report) cover none of those cases, so such a
# bead loops forever: it does the machine work on every pass, finds nothing to commit,
# and is requeued. delivers:check:<command> fills the gap: the filer states the command
# that proves the machine state is in place, and CHECK 5 runs it on every sentinel pass.
# A zero exit means done; non-zero means not yet.
#
# THE COMMAND IS THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERION, WRITTEN AT FILING. An aeon cannot choose the
# check at close time, because then it grades its own homework by picking a check it has
# already satisfied. The filer writes it; the sentinel verifies it on every pass.
#
# CASES, each asserted (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — a bare closed bead with no commit IS reopened. Ensures CHECK 5
#      is running and that the new case does not break the common path.
#
#   2. delivers:check:<passing command> — NOT reopened; command exits 0, state is present.
#
#   3. delivers:check:<failing command> — IS reopened; command exits non-zero, not yet.
#
#   4. delivers:check (no command) — IS reopened; malformed label is not evidence.
