#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS GUARDING. These two numbers are the ones that end a working day, so the
# expensive failure is not a missing segment but a reassuring one: a window rendered at 0%
# because the client sent none, or a fill projected across a reset boundary, is good news
# nobody measured. Every case that asserts something is ABSENT therefore first proves the same
# code path renders it when it is present (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control), and the
# `-`/`?`/0 distinction is asserted directly rather than assumed.
#
# THE FIRST CASE IS THE REGRESSION, AND IT IS FIRST ON PURPOSE. The suite that passed while the
# meter rendered a median of 250 %/h fed samples five minutes apart — a cadence the hook never
# produces. Evenly spaced readings are the one input on which every estimator agrees, so a
# suite built from them cannot see the defect that lives in the real cadence. The fixture below
# is a verbatim capture (law-fixtures-carry-real-cadence).
#
# THE CLOCK IS INJECTED. A projection is a statement about a moment, so a suite that used the
# real clock would be asserting against whenever it happened to run — and the reset-boundary
# case needs samples minutes apart without waiting minutes. `SPIRA_NOW` is read from the
# environment and is deliberately not a config key, so nothing an operator writes in spira.conf
# can freeze the clock of a live installation.
#
# AND IT RUNS UNDER `env -i`. A suite that inherits the operator's spira.conf writes samples
# into their real runtime directory and asserts against their real account
# (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
