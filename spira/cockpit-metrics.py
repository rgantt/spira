"""cockpit-metrics.py — the four Spira numbers this build already got wrong.

    cockpit-metrics.py <sentinel.log> <aeon-ledger.log> [window-hours]

Prints flat `KEY=value` lines on stdout. It is pure: two files in, keys out, no bead
queries and no git. That is what makes it testable against fixtures, which matters
because every number here is a claim about whether the harness is working, and a
dashboard that lies confidently is worse than no dashboard.

WHY THESE FOUR, AND NOT A STAT DUMP
-----------------------------------
The selection rule is the operator's: instrument the numbers that SURPRISED us. For Spira those
are the ones this build got wrong, each expensively:

  born vs lived    the first aeon the sentinel ever summoned was killed inside the same
                   second, after 1.6s of CPU: the service is Type=oneshot with the default
                   KillMode=control-group, so systemd tore down the whole cgroup when the
                   pass finished. The sentinel reported "summoned" every two minutes into
                   an empty log. A summon is not a worker.

  false ACTs       CHECK 6 re-landed one branch forever because `git branch -D` cannot
                   delete a branch a worktree holds, and the error went to /dev/null:
                     06:29:33 ACT landed spira/sp-stranded
                     06:31:35 ACT landed spira/sp-stranded
                   `acted` was therefore never 0, and CHECK 8 fires only when `acted` is 0,
                   so a harness spinning on one branch could never notice it was starved.
                   The reclaim probe had already done the same thing by matching its own
                   idle message. Twice is a pattern; this is the meter for it.

  passes since     CHECK 8 is the only tier that reaches a model, and the two bugs above
  judgement        both worked by making it unreachable. "It has never fired" and "it fired
                   40 passes ago" are the same picture from the outside and mean opposite
                   things, so the number is rendered rather than inferred.

  closed vs        law-closed-is-not-landed, as a running total instead of a rule. Computed
  landed           by cockpit.sh, which has the commit graph; not here.

WHAT COUNTS AS A FALSE ACT
--------------------------
An ACT that repeats in the IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING pass. A real state transition happens
once: a branch lands once, a bead is poisoned once, a lease is reclaimed once. The same
action reported twice two minutes apart means the first one did not take, which is the
exact shape of both bugs above.

Consecutive, not merely repeated within the window: reopening the same bead after an aeon
has failed it again is a genuine second action, and those passes are an hour apart, not
one apart. Summoning is excluded outright — an aeon is summoned every pass that has ready
work and a free slot, and that is the system working.

A missing or unreadable input renders `?` for the keys that depend on it, never 0. The
first version of the town collector returned 0 from its exception handler, so a broken
parser displayed as "all clear" and displaced the suspicion that would have prompted a
look.
