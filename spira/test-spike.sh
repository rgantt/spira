#
#   ./test-spike.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# The spike persona is defined almost entirely by two things a shell cannot check for itself:
# a predicate that must select its own beads and nobody else's, and a rule about what its
# branch is allowed to leave behind. The second is the one with teeth. A spike is given the
# full toolset on purpose — for most interesting questions the only honest answer to "is this
# feasible" comes from trying it — so nothing stops it committing an experiment beside its
# write-up, and the landing worker would then merge the experiment into the base while every
# downstream check passed: the aeon committed, the commit names the bead, the gate ran, the
# branch landed. `confine.sh` is the refusal, and this is the suite that holds it.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST and everything after it is read through that. A confinement
# check that finds nothing and one pointed at the wrong bead look identical from the outside,
# and the wrong one reads as all-clear (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). So an offender
# is planted and the matcher is required to name it before any silence here is believed.
#
# A REAL `bd` on a fixture database, and REAL git with a real bare remote. Every claim about
# confinement is a claim about what `git diff A...B` reports, and every claim about the
# partition is read through `bd ready` — a model of either is a second implementation, and the
# two disagreeing is a bug in neither and a failure in both.
#
# SPIRA_SPIKE_PATHS AND SPIRA_SPIKE_LABEL ARE PINNED TO NON-DEFAULTS throughout. Asserting
# against the shipped defaults would pass just as well if the code had the literal written in,
# which is the thing those keys exist to prevent.
#
# THE CONFINEMENT FENCE IS CLAIMED HERE ALONGSIDE THE WORKER THAT CALLS IT. `confine.sh` alone
# is not the property under test — the failure it exists to stop is a landing pass that never
# consults it, which is why a change to `landing.sh` has to select this suite too.
