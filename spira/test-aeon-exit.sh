# test-aeon-exit.sh — aeon.sh exits 0 after a successful bead close even when the
#                     claude session itself exits 1; a genuinely failed sweep still exits 1.
#
#   ./test-aeon-exit.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS TESTS. ops and qa run as named systemd units (spira-ops.service,
# spira-qa.service). Unlike transient units (systemd-run --collect, which are torn down
# on any exit), named units enter the FAILED state when their ExecStart exits non-zero.
# The aeon that closed sp-637b exited 1 — a stray non-zero from the last command the
# verdict block happened to run (a `bdq note` that returned non-zero) — and the unit
# was stuck in FAILED, making every `systemctl --state=failed` show a false alarm. An
# alert that is always firing is one nobody reads (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).
#
# WHAT IS TESTED:
#   1. Bead mode: when the bead is closed, aeon exits 0 even when claude exits 1.
#      Positive control: when the bead is NOT closed, aeon exits non-zero.
#   2. Sweep mode: when claude ran (produced tool calls and a result), aeon exits 0
#      even when claude exits 1.
#      Positive control: when the session was refused (no tool calls, no result),
#      aeon exits non-zero — a real ops failure remains visible.
#
# THE CLAUDE EXIT CODE IS THE VARIABLE UNDER TEST. The shim is configured to exit 0 or 1
# to test each case independently from what the session did. The shim also controls whether
# it closes the bead and what output it writes, which together drive the exit code logic.
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh against a real bd on a throwaway fixture, with a shim
# standing in for the model (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
