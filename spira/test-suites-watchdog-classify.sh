# test-suites-watchdog-classify.sh — a suite killed by the watchdog must be classified as
# timeout, not red, even when the suite traps TERM and exits 1 instead of 143.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS (sp-prhs2). The watchdog sends SIGTERM to the suite's process group.
# 43 of 160 suites in this tree trap TERM to run cleanup; their cleanup fires, execution
# resumes against a deleted scratch tree, and the suite exits 1.  The rc>=128 check that
# remaps to 124 (timeout) never fires for rc=1, so the kill is filed as a red test defect.
# The runner knows the watchdog fired; the classification must use that fact, not the exit
# code convention GNU timeout uses but this runner does not.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL IS FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The fixture suite must
# demonstrably be TERM-trapping and must be seen entering the watchdog path; the output
# "Terminated" the suite prints proves the trap ran.
#
# THE INTAKE IS THE REAL ONE on a throwaway database (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
#
# EVERY CONFIGURED VALUE IS PINNED TO A NON-DEFAULT (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
