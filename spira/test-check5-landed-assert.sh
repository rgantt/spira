# test-check5-landed-assert.sh — a bead whose commit is an ancestor of the base is never
#   reopened across repeated sentinel passes, and no attempt label is charged.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-xrwdg: beads sp-a9g, sp-37q, sp-m0s7, sp-796o had their commits
#   genuinely on the base branch, but CHECK 5's text search failed to find them (window
#   limit or subject-only format) and reopened them, charging attempts. Some were poisoned
#   and reopened again — sp-637b cycled six times because the poison label did not stop
#   the reopen loop, and attempt 6 was charged against work that had landed at attempt 1.
#
# WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM test-check5-body-search.sh. That suite verifies the SEARCH
#   MECHANISM (deep history walks the full ancestry; body search covers %B). This suite
#   verifies the PROPERTY: a bead genuinely on the base — proven by git ancestry, not by
#   trusting the same text search being tested — is never reopened and never charged,
#   even across two consecutive passes. The second pass catches a latent bug where the
#   first changes bead state in a way that makes the second reopen; the direct ancestry
#   check proves the fixture is correct before the sentinel ever runs.
#
# SEEN TO FAIL AGAINST UNFIXED CODE. The deep-history case pushes 401 commits after the
#   landing commit, placing it beyond the old 400-commit window. Against the unfixed
#   sentinel (which used `git log -n 400 --format='%B'`), pass 1 would reopen the bead
#   and charge attempt 1 — the assertion "pass 1: sp-land stays closed" would fail as:
#     FAIL pass 1: sp-land stays closed: wanted [closed] got [open]
#   and the attempt assertion would follow as:
#     FAIL pass 1: no attempt label charged: wanted [] got [sp-attempt-1]
#   Both were verified against a patched copy before this test was committed (sp-xrwdg).
#
# defect: sp-xrwdg
# covers: spira/sentinel.sh
# hermetic-ok: uses a fixture database and a local git repo, no systemd or gh
