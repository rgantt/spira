# WHAT THIS REPLACES
# ------------------
# `gt convoy land` step 3, "cleans up polecat worktrees associated with the convoy's
# tracked issues". Steps 2, 4 and 5 — all-closed, close the convoy, notify — are
# pilgrimage.sh; this is the part that was left. The design ledger predicted this
# responsibility would vanish with polecat worktrees, and it did not: the aeon runner
# reintroduced worktrees on purpose, because the first supervised aeon checked its branch
# out in the shared tree and swept the interactive session's files into its commit. Every
# aeon therefore leaves a branch AND a worktree behind, and until now nothing removed
# either.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX, MEASURED
# ---------------------------------------
# CHECK 6 in the sentinel ended a successful land with `git branch -q -D "$br" 2>/dev/null`.
# git REFUSES to delete a branch that a worktree has checked out —
#
#     error: cannot delete branch 'feat' used by worktree at '/tmp/.../wt'
#
# — and the aeon's own worktree is always holding exactly that branch. So the delete could
# never succeed, the error went to /dev/null, and the branch survived. The next pass found
# the same closed bead with the same branch, merged it again (already up to date), pushed
# again (a no-op) and counted another action. From .runtime/spira/sentinel.log:
#
#     2026-09-05T06:29:33Z spira: ACT landed spira/sp-stranded
#     2026-09-05T06:31:35Z spira: ACT landed spira/sp-stranded
#
# That is not merely untidy. `acted` was never 0, and CHECK 8 — the judgement tier — fires
# only when `acted` is 0, so a harness that re-lands one branch forever can never notice it
# is starved. It is the same false-action bug already commented at CHECK 2, arriving by a
# different route: a cleanup step that does not verify its own effect reports success on
# the strength of having tried.
#
# So every deletion here is CHECKED AFTER THE FACT, and a branch that survives its own
# deletion is reported FAILED rather than counted.
#
# WHAT MAY BE DELETED
# -------------------
# Only a branch whose every change the repository's base ref already holds — either because
# the branch is an ancestor of it, or because merging the branch into it would produce the
# base's own tree. Never a tip comparison and never the bead's status
# (law-closed-is-not-landed): CLOSED is a claim about a database, and the question here is
# whether deleting this ref can lose work. If the remote is unreachable the fetch fails, the
# base ref is stale, and a freshly-landed branch reads as unlanded and is KEPT — the fetch
# failure biases toward hoarding branches, which is recoverable, rather than toward deleting
# work, which is not.
#
# The second reading is what a squashing repository needs, and it is not a relaxation. A
# squash lands the diff as one new commit the branch is not in the history of, so ancestry
# alone keeps that branch forever; and a branch that is never sent is re-examined on every
# pass, where the landing worker's rebase conflicts against changes already on the base and
# reopens the finished bead. Nothing about that repeats differently, so it repeats until
# someone deletes the ref by hand.
#
# An unlanded branch is never deleted, whatever its bead says. That is CHECK 6's problem to
# land or reopen, not this program's to tidy away.
