# test-cockpit-rebuild.sh — rebuild.sh builds a cockpit from nothing, and refuses to kill a
#   server that still holds live work.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. On 2026-09-09 the tmux server on the default socket wedged and took
# the cockpit, both dashboards and every Monitor with it. `layout.sh up` could not help: it
# REPAIRS a cockpit and its first line is `has-session || exit 1`, so with no server there was
# nothing to repair. The recovery was a dozen hand-run commands whose ORDER is load-bearing and
# was written down nowhere. rebuild.sh is that sequence; this is the proof it still works.
#
# THE ORDER IS THE POINT, and case 2 is what pins it. The dashboards belong in `brain:0`,
# because `cockpit` does not own windows — it holds LINKED copies of `brain:0` and `hunk:0`.
# Building the layout in a new cockpit window produces something that renders correctly, looks
# right at a glance, and is not the cockpit; the view watcher goes DEGRADED because the window
# it steers is not the window it is looking at. So the suite asserts the LINKS, not merely that
# three panes exist somewhere.
#
# AN ISOLATED TMUX SERVER, NOT A MOCK. TMUX_TMPDIR gives this suite its own server, and every
# tmux invocation below and inside rebuild.sh inherits it — so it drives the real layout.sh and
# the real cockpit-remote against a real server, and touches nothing Ryan is looking at.
#
# THE SOCKET PATH MUST BE SHORT. A unix socket path is capped at 108 bytes; the session
# scratchpad blows through it and tmux answers "File name too long", which the first draft of
# rebuild.sh misread as a wedged server. mktemp -d under /tmp keeps it short, and case 4 pins
# the classifier so that misreading cannot come back.
#
# defect: sp-9zs0y
# covers: cockpit/rebuild.sh cockpit/layout.sh
# hermetic-ok: its own TMUX_TMPDIR server and temp dirs; reads no operator state it can change
