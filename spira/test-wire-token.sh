# test-wire-token.sh — SENT is the wire token between sending.sh, sentinel.sh, and
# cockpit-metrics.py. Three programs parse each other's stdout; a rename that lands in the
# emitter but not both parsers yields ZERO rather than an error, so the failure mode is
# silence rather than a crash. This suite is the positive control: it fails the moment any of
# the three disagrees about the token name.
#
# WHY A STATIC CHECK, NOT AN INTEGRATION RUN
# -------------------------------------------
# The silent-zero failure mode is precisely what an integration run would miss: if sending.sh
# emits REAPED and sentinel.sh greps for SENT, the sentinel logs "sent 0 branches" and exits
# 0, which is the ordinary idle-pass output. Only a check that reads ALL THREE files and
# verifies they share one token can detect the drift before it reaches the log.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS THE EMITTER LINE
# --------------------------------
# sending.sh emits `say "SENT …"` lines; the token is the first word of that argument.
# sentinel.sh greps `^SENT`; cockpit-metrics.py does `t.startswith("SENT")`.
# Each grep below targets the functional form — the literal string as it would appear in the
# source — so a rename that updates every grep but not the say, or vice versa, is caught here.
