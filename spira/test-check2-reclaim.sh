# test-check2-reclaim.sh — CHECK 2's dead-worker reaper skips IN_PROGRESS beads whose
#   only open dep carries the ask label, and stops skipping once that dep closes.
#
#   ./test-check2-reclaim.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-mfa4 hit the reclaim loop six times: it was IN_PROGRESS because its
# aeon correctly exited after diagnosing a needs-ryan dep, but CHECK 2's time-based reaper
# cannot distinguish "correctly waiting" from "genuinely dead". It reclaimed the bead,
# summoned a new aeon, which re-derived the same diagnosis and exited — a ~180m-period
# loop. check2_protect_waiting (lib.sh) labels the bead SPIRA_RECLAIM_SKIP_LABEL while its
# only open dep carries the ask label, so the reaper's --exclude-label skips it. The label
# is removed when the dep closes, letting the reaper reclaim the stale lease on that pass.
#
# FOUR CASES, ALL SIDES EXERCISED:
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL (dead worker, no deps) — reclaim fires.
#      Without this, a protect-everything implementation reads as correct.
#   2. PROTECTED (only open dep carries ask label) — skip label applied, reaper skips.
#   3. UNPROTECTED AFTER DEP CLOSES — skip label removed, reaper reclaims on same pass.
#   4. NOT PROTECTED (open dep without ask label) — no skip label, reaper can fire.
#
# A REAL bd ON A FIXTURE DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). check2_protect_waiting
# calls bd label add/remove and bd show; a stub would drift silently and prove nothing
# about the real label path.
