# test-timeout.sh — a session killed by the lane cap (rc=124) charges no attempt.
#
#   ./test-timeout.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES. sp-m56w ran four consecutive ops sessions at 480s each. Every
# one ended rc=124 (timeout killed the claude process), with nothing committed. The cleanup
# path in aeon.sh classified the trace as `unlanded` and bumped the attempt counter. The bead
# poisoned at attempt 3; the fourth session claimed it one second after the label landed.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST:
#   1. SESSION_RC=124 + committed=no charges the timeout counter, not the attempt counter.
#   2. After FAYTH_TIMEOUT_LIMIT consecutive timeouts the bead is poisoned and an ask is
#      filed — "too large for its lane", not "change the approach".
#   3. A claim released because spira-poison raced the predicate check is a clean exit.
#   4. SP_OPS_AGE reports 0 when an ops aeon pid is live, not the stale log mtime.
#
