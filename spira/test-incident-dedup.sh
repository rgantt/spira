#
# THE DEFECTS THIS SUITE GUARDS AGAINST.
#
# sp-csvzn: bd list --json omitted the external_ref field. _dedup_incident reads external_ref
# from bd list --json output; when the field was absent bead.get('external_ref') returned None
# for every candidate, so every filing looked like "no open incident" and filed a fresh bead.
# 17-18+ surplus beads per external_ref were observed in production.
#
# sp-ew54u: Python variable expansion bug — $SPIRA_BD or $SPIRA_DB inside a single-quoted
# Python heredoc block was not expanded by the shell, so the Python code received the literal
# string "$SPIRA_BD" rather than the database path. The bdq call then addressed the caller's
# default store instead of the configured one, silently finding no candidates.
#
# sp-vq796: _dedup_incident did not check the external_ref field when iterating candidates.
# The label-keyed path (ref:<hash>) could return at most 1 candidate, but if the check
# against external_ref was absent, ANY bead with a matching label (even one from a hash
# collision) would be treated as the incumbent — or, if the Python code did not reach the
# comparison at all, every lookup returned empty and every filing went to bdq create.
#
# WHY THREE DISTINCT DEFECTS NEED ONE UNIFIED SUITE. All three surface identically from the
# outside: more than one bead exists for a given external_ref after N filings. A single suite
# that files N times and asserts count=1 is the minimal property that catches any of them, and
# it is exactly the test that did not exist when they shipped.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL IS FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Before asserting that N
# filings dedupe to 1, the suite proves that N direct insertions produce N beads. If the count
# helper is broken or SPIRA_DB is mis-set, the positive control fails, and the dedup test is
# not trusted. A suite that skips this step cannot distinguish "dedupe works" from "count is
# always 0".
#
# The suite also explicitly verifies that bd list --json includes external_ref (sp-csvzn).
# A missing field is not caught by asserting count=1 if the dedup happens to work for other
# reasons; the field assertion is the positive-control check for sp-csvzn specifically.
#
# Driven through the REAL incident.sh against a REAL bd on a throwaway fixture database.
# The dedup is a database read followed by a conditional write; a stub cannot reproduce the
# failure modes above — each requires a real schema (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
