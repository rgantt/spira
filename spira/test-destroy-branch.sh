# test-destroy-branch.sh — spira_destroy_branch refuses to delete a branch
# whose content has not landed on the base, and succeeds once it has.
#
#   ./test-destroy-branch.sh
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST (sp-w6bw / sp-hl72 / sp-mqsl). Before the content fence was
# added, spira_destroy_branch called git branch -D unconditionally once two
# lightweight checks passed (no live holder, not checked out in a worktree).
# A branch reclaimed or slain before its commits reached origin/main could be
# garbage-collected within minutes, with no error and no log line from landing.
# sp-w6bw filed the assertion requirement; sp-kq8l implemented it; sp-hl72 wrote this test.
#
# The fence uses content_landed (diff-based), not merge-base --is-ancestor
# (ancestry-based). The distinction matters for squash repositories: a squash
# merge replays the branch's diff as one new commit that is NOT an ancestor of
# the branch tip, so ancestry alone says "not landed" about work that is
# demonstrably on the base. This test covers both cases:
#
#   (a) unlanded real-file branch -> refused
#   (b) squash-landed branch -> approved (ancestry would refuse this)
#
# A POSITIVE CONTROL precedes each absence assertion: bypass the fence with a
# non-empty caller arg and confirm the branch IS deleted, proving the control
# path reaches the deletion. Without it, a version that refused everything
# would pass both absence checks (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# A REAL GIT REPOSITORY with a bare remote, because the claims are about what
# git says about refs and trees (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). No real
# beads database: the status seam stands in for the holder witness, keeping
# this suite off the database and its 6-second init cost.
