# inventory.sh — refuse to ship one operator's infrastructure.
#
#   inventory.sh                 scan every tracked file; exit 1 naming each offender
#   inventory.sh --scan <file>   scan one file; print the offending tokens, one per line
#   inventory.sh --patterns      print the pattern list and exit
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR. This repository is meant to be cloned by someone else. A comment naming
# a repository, a deploy path, a host or a person teaches their agent to reason about
# infrastructure that does not exist, and sometimes to act on it. The rule and the trap are
# what make the code worth reading; the case history behind them belongs in the operator's
# own notes.
#
# WHY A PROGRAM AND NOT A HABIT. A sanitising pass done by hand is done once. This runs from
# the landing gate on every branch, so the next comment that names a box is refused at the
# moment it is written rather than found by a reader who already believed it.
#
# WHAT IT LOOKS FOR is structural, so it needs no list of the operator's own names:
#
#   an absolute path rooted in a home or workspace directory   /home/<user>/…  /Users/<u>/…
#                                                              /workspaces/…
#   an e-mail address that is neither a reserved example domain (RFC 2606 / RFC 6761) nor
#   the `git@host` SSH remote form
#   a provenance mark naming a person and a date               (per <Name>, YYYY-MM-DD)
#
# AND WHATEVER THE OPERATOR ADDS. `inventory-deny`, one extended-regex per line, `#`
# comments. It ships with no entries: your repository and host names are yours to name, and
# a shipped deny-list of somebody else's names is itself the inventory it is hunting.
#
# COMMENTS ARE SCANNED, NOT STRIPPED. Every occurrence this was written to catch was in a
# comment; a version that stripped them first passed a tree that named seven repositories,
# a host and a person across ninety lines.

cat >&2 <<'WHY'

REFUSED by inventory.sh — the files above name one operator's infrastructure.

This repository is meant to be cloned. Keep the rule and the trap, which are why the code
is correct; move the case history — the path, the host, the repository name, the person and
the date — to wherever your own notes live, and cite it from there.

If a token above is genuinely generic, the deny-list and the pattern list are both editable;
a fence is a polite refusal, not a wall.

exit 1
