# test-cockpit-db.sh — unanswered.sh ordering and the ask path, against a real bd.
#
#   ./test-cockpit-db.sh
#
# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. unanswered.sh read rows[-1] positionally and never
# sorted. bd comments orders by created_at at second resolution, so two comments written
# in the same second come back in an order nothing defines. The turn marker inverted: a
# thread Ryan spoke last on read as answered and dropped off the "waiting on a reply" list,
# which is the exact failure that page exists to prevent. Observed 2026-09-06 in
# test-cockpit-dbs.sh (later deleted): a fixture that added my reply and his answer
# back-to-back produced identical created_at stamps and unanswered.sh reported "no threads
# are waiting on a reply". The suite worked around it with a sleep 2 — the tell that the
# ordering is the program's to establish and not the test's to arrange around.
