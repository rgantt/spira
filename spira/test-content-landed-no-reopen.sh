# test-content-landed-no-reopen.sh — CHECK 5 does not reopen a bead whose branch the
#   Sending reaped by content, nor a poisoned one; ordinary closed beads still are.
#
#   ./test-content-landed-no-reopen.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sending.sh deletes a branch when content_landed says merging it would
# produce exactly the base tree — the work is on the base, but under someone else's commit,
# so no merge commit ever names the bead. One pass later CHECK 5 searches the base subjects
# for the id, finds nothing, and cannot fall back on its "the work is still on a branch"
# guard either, because the Sending deleted that branch. So it reopened the bead, a fresh
# aeon redid finished work, closed it, the Sending reaped it again, and CHECK 5 reopened it
# again. Measured on 2026-09-08: 99 reopens over 80 beads, 34 of them landing 86-143s after
# that same bead's own SENT — one sentinel pass, no jitter. sp-637b went six rounds, sp-62ji
# burned three aeons, and sp-0092 cost $7.97 for a single one of them.
#
# Poison did not bound it: sp-637b was poisoned after 3 attempts at 21:08:30 and reopened as
# attempt 4 at 21:12:54. So the poison label is terminal for this check too.
#
# THREE CASES, because an exemption with no positive control is indistinguishable from a
# check that never fires at all (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — a closed bead with no commit naming it and no label IS reopened.
#   2. CONTENT-LANDED   — a closed bead carrying `content-landed` is NOT reopened.
#   3. POISONED         — a closed bead carrying `spira-poison` is NOT reopened.
#
# And the seam: the labels must actually be present in the BULK listing CHECK 5 reads them
# from. The supersession exemption once shipped broken because the field was absent there,
# and the first attempt at this fix shipped a guard that grepped `bd show` output for a JSON
# shape bd does not emit — it matched nothing, so the loop went on running while the bead
# said it was fixed.
#
# defect: sp-796o
# covers: spira/sentinel.sh spira/sending.sh
# hermetic-ok: uses a fixture database and a local git repo, no systemd or gh
