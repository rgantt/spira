# test-watchd-tail.sh — one reader per watcher, and the reader that lets go cleanly.
#
#   ./test-watchd-tail.sh
#
# WHAT IT HOLDS, AND THE OUTAGE IT COMES FROM. A watcher is a log plus ONE cursor. Two
# concurrent tails share that cursor, so each marks lines read on the other's behalf and both
# deliver every line — there is no coherent reading of two readers, which is why the
# cardinality is a lock and not advice.
#
# The advice is what was there, and it could not be followed. The session hook told a fresh
# context to "run ListAgents first, and attach only the streams not already listed there", but
# ListAgents enumerates agents and sessions and NO tool enumerates a session's own Monitors. So
# the check reported "none attached" on every context reset, and a session cleared several times
# accumulated seven readers: measured on 2026-09-08, twelve live processes on two logs, three of
# them orphaned `tail -F` dating back sixteen hours to sessions that had ended. Ryan's verdicts
# arrived in triplicate in the one place a duplicated line costs the most.
#
#   1. A SECOND TAIL REFUSES, and refuses fast enough that a Monitor ends rather than lingers.
#   2. THE EVENT IS DELIVERED ONCE. This is the acceptance criterion — the assertion is on the
#      count of deliveries of one line across BOTH readers, because a refusal that still let a
#      duplicate through would pass every other check here.
#   3. THE REFUSAL NAMES ITS OVERRIDE. A fence is a polite refusal, not a wall.
#   4. `--takeover` REALLY TRANSFERS IT. The incumbent's `tail` and `awk` outlive their wrapper
#      and hold the same lock through an inherited descriptor, so killing the wrapper alone is
#      a takeover that reports success and changes nothing. Asserted by the stream that follows.
#   5. THE LOCK IS RELEASED BY EXIT, never by a pid file. flock means a crash, a kill and a
#      session that simply went away all release it; a stale lock cannot exist.
#   6. NO ORPHANS. Killing a reader leaves no `tail -F` behind streaming into a closed pipe.
#
# It needs no database, no beads server and no systemd. It runs against a scratch SPIRA_RUN, so
# it cannot see, disturb or be confused by the operator's own watchers.
