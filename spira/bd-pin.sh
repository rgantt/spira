# bd-pin.sh — record and verify the installed bd binary's known migration count.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. A rebuild that installs bd at a different migration count from the
# database cursor causes bd to exit 0 with its complaint on stdout — callers that check
# exit status read success and parse the error as data. Pinning the known migration count
# after every install makes an unannounced rebuild visible to doctor.sh before the loop
# tries to run (see the SPIRA_BD_PIN key in conf.sh and the "bd schema" section in
# doctor.sh).
#
#   bd-pin.sh show   — print the recorded pin (default)
#   bd-pin.sh write  — record current bd state to the pin file
#
# The pin file location is SPIRA_BD_PIN (from conf.sh; default $SPIRA_RUN/bd-pin).
# Run bd-pin.sh write right after building and installing a new bd binary.
#
# BUILD FLAGS TO RECORD. The bd binary on this box was built CGO_ENABLED=0 (statically
# linked, zero ICU symbols), which means it cannot use embedded Dolt and must talk to a
# dolt sql-server in server mode. The next person to rebuild needs to match this: a CGO
# build opens an embedded engine that does not talk to the existing server, and the two
# can diverge silently. The pin file records both so neither fact has to be re-derived.
