# WHAT THIS SUITE IS GUARDING. The archivist sweeps a session when its turn count has drifted
# past SPIRA_ARCHIVIST_EVERY since the last successful archive, regardless of context depth.
# A session that has not drifted is not swept. A session whose last run failed is not re-fired.
# The band-3 push notification fires at most once per session. A sweep is skipped entirely when
# the account capacity is paused. A pass archives at most SPIRA_ARCHIVIST_PER_PASS sessions,
# choosing the most drifted first. No two archives run concurrently, even across entry points.
