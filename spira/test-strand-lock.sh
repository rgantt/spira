# test-strand-lock.sh — two concurrent strand.sh check runs must file exactly one escalation.
#
#   ./test-strand-lock.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-uq55c: strand.sh's "escalate exactly once per episode" guarantee broke
# under concurrent callers — sentinel + concierge, or operator + timer. Both runners read
# was_escalated=0 from state_apply before either had written escalated=1 via state_mark, so
# both filed the same escalation. Observed 2026-09-10: sp-9dcp3 and sp-km7d0, identical
# title, identical 14 ids, identical evidence, both reached Ryan's queue.
#
# TWO BUGS, ONE FIX:
#   1. The read-modify-write sequence in cmd_check was not locked — a second concurrent runner
#      saw stale state and acted on it. Fixed with flock --nonblock on $STATE.lock; the second
#      runner declines rather than proceeding on stale state.
#   2. Both state_apply and state_mark wrote to the fixed name path+".tmp", shared by every
#      concurrent writer. A partial write by one could be promoted by the other via os.replace.
#      Fixed by using tempfile.mkstemp (unique name per writer, same directory).
#
# PRE-FIX FAILURE (seen against the unfixed tree, 2026-09-10):
#
#   escalation count: 2   (wanted 1)
#
# The fixture uses --from to bypass live graph queries. STRAND_GRACE=0 ensures the strand
# fires immediately without waiting for the 15-minute grace window.
