#   reflect.sh "<ids>"
#
# WHY THIS IS SEPARATE AND RARE
# -----------------------------
# The harness is meant to be cheap, quick and frequent; this is none of those. It runs at
# most once an hour, only from sentinel.sh CHECK 8, and only when there is no rule left to
# apply — because if there were a rule, it would already be a check.
#
# Its output is not an action. It writes a diagnosis and, when the fix is one the operator must
# choose between, an escalation carrying a default. Letting it act directly would make the
# expensive tier the one with the most authority, which is backwards: the deterministic
# checks act, and this one explains why they had nothing to do.
#
# WHAT TO DO WITH ITS OUTPUT
# --------------------------
# A stall it diagnoses once should become a deterministic check in sentinel.sh, so this is
# never asked about it again. That is the ladder: custom -> advisory -> statute ->
# mechanism. Inference is where a rule is discovered, not where it lives.

PROMPT="You are the Spira sentinel's judgement tier. Every deterministic check has passed
and the work graph is still not moving: beads remain open, none are ready, none are
running, and nothing was reclaimed, poisoned, reopened or landed this pass.

## Your task

Diagnose why nothing is ready, in at most 150 words. Then answer exactly one question:
is this a gap a program could have detected? If yes, state the deterministic check that
would have caught it, precisely enough to implement in sentinel.sh — that is the valuable
output, because a stall diagnosed by inference twice is a check that was never written.

If the fix needs a decision only $SPIRA_OPERATOR can make, end with a line beginning 'ESCALATE:'
followed by the decision stated as a question with a default. Otherwise end with a line
beginning 'CHECK:' followed by the proposed deterministic check. Do not take any action
and do not modify any bead."
