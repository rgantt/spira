#
#   watchd.sh manifest              every valid row, expanded: name|kind|target|health
#   watchd.sh units                 the unit name of every `daemon` row, one per line
#   watchd.sh keys                  the placeholders a row may name, one per line
#   watchd.sh exec <name>           become that watcher; this is what ExecStart calls
#   watchd.sh status                a table, one line per watcher, then a DEGRADED block
#                                   naming each unwell watcher and why — see below
#   watchd.sh drain [name] [--all]  print what nobody has read, and mark it read
#   watchd.sh peek [name] [--all] [--limit N]
#                                   the same, capped, and marking NOTHING read
#   watchd.sh tail <name> [--all]   replay from the cursor, then stream; for a Monitor
#   watchd.sh restart [name]        restart the unit behind a watcher
#   watchd.sh notify                escalate events nobody has drained; for a timer
#   watchd.sh health-ids <file>     assert a state file names at least one of our own beads
#   watchd.sh health-view <prog> <session>
#                                   assert the view a follower steers matches the one it wants
#
# `status` EMITS TWO SECTIONS AND A PARSER MUST KNOW IT: a header, one row per watcher, then
# — only when a health probe failed — a blank line, the word DEGRADED alone, and one indented
# `<name>: <why>` per afflicted watcher. Field one of a ROW is a watcher name; the lines below
# the blank are not rows and field one of them is not a name. A consumer that reads "everything
# after the header" as the table therefore generates commands naming watchers that do not
# exist, which is what the session hook did until it was made to stop at the blank line.
#
# WHAT A READER LATCHES ONTO is two files per watcher and nothing else: `<name>.log`,
# newline-delimited and append-only, and `<name>.cursor`, an integer counting the lines
# already delivered. Every command below is arithmetic over those two, which is what keeps
# the contract agent-agnostic — `tail -n +$((cursor+1)) -F <log>` is a conforming client, and
# a session that cannot run this script loses nothing but ergonomics.
#
# SYSTEMD OWNS THE PROCESS AND THIS OWNS NOTHING. `status` asks systemd what is running and
# `restart` asks systemd to restart it; nothing here launches a process, detaches one, writes
# a pid file, or decides a watcher is alive by signalling it. There is deliberately no second
# supervision scheme beside systemd's, because a second one is how the defect that prompted
# all of this survived: a watcher started by hand went on reading a database that had been
# retired underneath it for three days, looking perfectly healthy in every process listing,
# while nothing outside that session even knew it was supposed to exist.
#
# WHY A DISPATCHER RATHER THAN A PATH IN THE UNIT. `spira-watch@.service` is ONE template
# taking the watcher's name as its instance, so adding a watcher is a row in the manifest
# plus an install run. Its ExecStart names this script and the instance and nothing else, so
# the manifest stays the only source of truth and no unit encodes a path — a unit with a path
# baked into it runs on exactly one box, and systemd's failure for a wrong one is a bare "No
# such file or directory" in a journal nobody is watching.
#
# WHY A MALFORMED MANIFEST REFUSES THE WHOLE FILE. Every fault is named with its line number
# and then nothing is emitted at all. A parser that skipped the bad row and returned the good
# ones would let `install.sh` enable a partial set and report success — and a watcher that was
# never started looks exactly like a watcher with nothing to say. Refusing is loud; skipping
# is a silence somebody has to notice (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).

# vocabulary, and because the same expression has to serve `drain` and `tail` — the two used

# WHY THERE IS A HEALTH COLUMN AT ALL. A watcher reading a database that was retired
# underneath it and a watcher with nothing to report are both SILENT, and silence is what a
# process listing, a unit state and an unread count all agree on. One here looked healthy in
# every one of those for three days while seeing nothing, and the answer given in the meantime
# reached nobody. So each row may carry an assertion the watcher must be able to satisfy, and
# it is run HERE and nowhere else — `status` is not on any timer, so a probe costs nothing in
# the steady state and the fence in law-fence-loops-on-shared-hardware is not engaged.
#
# THREE COLUMNS, THREE DIFFERENT WAYS TO BE WRONG, and none of them subsumes another:
#
#   HEALTH      the watcher cannot see what it is supposed to be watching
#   LAST-EVENT  it can see, and has stopped producing — active, healthy and mute
#   RESTARTS    it is being restarted, which is how the mtime staleness check is metered
#
# EVERY VALUE IS WHITESPACE-FREE and every unknown is `-`, never `0` and never blank. This is
# a table addressed by column index, and it is read by things that will act on it.

# cmd_health_view <program> <session> — the assertion that catches a correct state machine

#
# THE WATCHER THIS JUDGES DECIDES WHICH WINDOW THE OPERATOR IS LOOKING AT, which makes it the
# highest-consequence one here and the one whose failure is hardest to see: it was found
# stopped with its state exactly right — a review was active, it knew the review window was
# wanted — and the operator went on reading the other one. Nothing in a unit state, an unread
# count or a process listing says that, because the follower flips ON TRANSITIONS ONLY. A
# process that is not running has no transitions to miss, so it is silent in precisely the way
# a healthy idle one is.
#
# SO THE ASSERTION COMPARES INTENT AGAINST THE WORLD, not one report against itself. The
# program answers what SHOULD be visible (`want: <session>`); the multiplexer is asked what IS
# visible; DEGRADED is the two disagreeing. That is the whole discriminating fact, and it is
# available to anything that can run two commands.
#
# WHY WINDOW IDS AND NOT THE NAME THE PROGRAM PRINTS. A window is named for the program running
# in it, so the visible window's NAME is the same string whether the right window is showing or
# the wrong one — the observed failure and the healthy state rendered identically. Ids do not
# collide, and the follower's own mechanism is a window linked into two sessions, which is one
# window object and therefore one id.
#
# EVERY WAY THIS CAN FAIL TO ANSWER IS DEGRADED OR REFUSED, NEVER OK. A missing multiplexer, a
# session that is not there, a program that prints no `want:` line — none of them PROVED the
# view is being steered, and a probe that answered OK when it could not run is the broken check
# reported as an all-clear that this column exists to end (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).

# A SESSION HOOK CANNOT CLOSE THIS HOLE, and that is the whole reason this command exists.
# A hook fires at a SESSION BOUNDARY, which is a property of one client: an event produced
# while nothing is running waits for the next session to open, and for a headless agent that
# is never. So a timer asks the question a boundary cannot — has anything actionable been
# sitting here with nobody to take it — and escalates through the channel that needs no
# session at all.
#
# IT DOES NOT ADVANCE THE CURSOR, and that is not an omission. Escalating is an extra copy of
# the event, never a substitute for it: the lines stay unread, so the next reader to latch
# still gets them. A notify that drained what it reported would make the ask the ONLY delivery
# and would silently clear the condition it was reporting on.
#
# ONLY ACTIONABLE LINES COUNT. A watcher's log is mostly progress, and paging somebody because
# a watcher was busy is the false alarm that teaches them to scroll past the real one
# (law-alerts-must-be-actionable). It is the same expression `drain` and `tail` filter with,
# for the same reason it is a key: a second opinion about what matters is how two commands
