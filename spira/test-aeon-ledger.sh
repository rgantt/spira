# test-aeon-ledger.sh — the `done` ledger line says what the session SPENT, and says `?`
# rather than 0 for anything it could not read.
#
#   ./test-aeon-ledger.sh
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. Every session's terminal `result` record carries its duration, its
# turns, its token usage and its cost, and that trace is the only copy anyone keeps. Putting
# those on the aeon ledger's disposition line turns "where did the hours go" and "what does a
# landed bead cost" into an awk one-liner over one small file, instead of a purpose-built
# script over tens of megabytes of traces.
#
# WHY IT NEEDS A SUITE AT ALL. The failure mode is silent by construction: a parser that
# stops finding the record does not error, it renders — and if it rendered 0 the ledger would
# report a fleet of free, instantaneous aeons, which is a reassuring number and therefore the
# worst possible one. So `?` and 0 are asserted as DIFFERENT answers on every field, and the
# case that produces each is driven end to end.
#
# THE BOUNDARY IS THE OTHER HALF. The trace is appended to across attempts, so a session that
# died before speaking sits directly beneath a previous attempt's complete `result` record.
# Reading the file rather than the attempt's own segment would bill the dead session for the
# live one's tokens, and nothing downstream could tell. Attempt 2 is therefore asserted to be
# unknown while attempt 1, in the same file, is asserted to be a full reading — the positive
# control without which "it says ?" proves only that the parser is broken
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh against a real bd on a throwaway fixture, with a shim
# standing in for the model, because what is under test is what the harness records about a
# session it ran — and a model of aeon.sh would be a second implementation of the thing in
# question (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
