# test-reclaim-slay-branch-guard.sh — end-to-end: spira_destroy_branch refuses to delete
#   a branch carrying commits not on origin/<base>, in the reclaim and slay paths.
#
#   ./test-reclaim-slay-branch-guard.sh
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST (sp-r0ay / sp-mqsl). Before the content fence was added,
# spira_destroy_branch called git branch -D unconditionally. A reclaim or slay
# operation on a bead with unlanded commits would silently lose that work with no
# error and no log entry from landing. This test exercises the complete stack —
# real git repository, real beads database, real slay.sh — to verify that work
# is protected in both paths.
#
# Two complementary assertions:
#
#   SLAY PATH. slay.sh parks unlanded commits at refs/slain/<id> before calling
#   spira_destroy_branch with the "slain" bypass. The test verifies the commit
#   survives deletion at that ref — that the durable copy was written BEFORE the
#   branch was removed. A version that called git branch -D unconditionally would
#   pass the parking assertion but then silently delete the parked ref too, so the
#   test checks the ref explicitly after the branch is gone.
#
#   GATE PATH. spira_destroy_branch called without the caller bypass (the shape a
#   new reclaim path would take if it forgot to park first) MUST refuse deletion of
#   an unlanded branch. The gate is what "reclaim/slay gates must verify branch is
#   on base before deletion" actually means — the function-level fence that catches
#   any caller that reached the deletion without first securing the work.
#
# A POSITIVE CONTROL precedes each absence assertion so an implementation that
# refused or deleted everything would not pass silently
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# A REAL bd ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency): slay.sh
# reads the bead's status and repo label; a stub would drift. A real git fixture
# with a bare remote for branch operations.
