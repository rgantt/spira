# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. loom/target/release/loom is in .gitignore, so
# landing a source change ships nothing to the running server — the unit restarts into
# the same old binary forever. Without this check, a change to loom/src is invisible
# to the running process until someone hand-runs cargo, and the symptom ("change had
# no effect") is indistinguishable from a broken implementation.
