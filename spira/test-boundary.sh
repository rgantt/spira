#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# boundary.sh check compared the rendered manifest against the published targets but never
# verified that the manifest rows themselves referenced existing files. A deletion that left
# its row standing passed the staleness check undetected because the rendered output still
# matched the published table — both sides agreed on a file that had not existed for three
# commits. This suite pins the new behavior: a row naming a nonexistent path must fail
# `check`, and a clean manifest must pass.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). A check that
# cannot detect anything and a check that happens to find a clean tree print the same thing.
# The plant comes before the clean assertion, so the clean reading means something.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS A MINIMAL SCRATCH HARNESS rooted under TMP. boundary.sh derives the
# repository root one directory up from itself, so the scratch layout mirrors the shipped
# layout: TMP/spira/boundary.sh, TMP/spira/boundary (the manifest), TMP/README.md (the
# published target). conf.sh is stubbed to set SPIRA_WIKI="" — this test is for the
# filesystem check, not for wiki rendering.
#
# covers: spira/boundary.sh spira/boundary
