# test-cockpit-sphere.sh — SP_POISON counts all poisoned beads, not just plan-labelled ones.
#
#   ./test-cockpit-sphere.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR (sp-b3ub). cockpit.sh computed SP_POISON inside the
# spira,plan-scoped sphere-grid block. Poison is applied only by aeon.sh's closing rule
# when SOP_REQUIRED=1 — which fires for ops and qa personas whose beads carry `incident`,
# not `plan`. So the filter and the population were disjoint by construction, and SP_POISON
# was structurally always zero against eleven open poisoned beads on the day of discovery.
#
# THE FIX: sphere_keys() issues a separate query on the spira-poison label alone (status !=
# closed), independent of the sphere-grid scoping. This suite asserts that the value equals
# the raw count from bd list --label spira-poison on a fixture that carries ONLY incident-
# labelled poisoned beads — the population the old query could never have seen.
#
# EVERY CASE IS A PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The negative control
# (no poisoned beads) proves the check can read a true zero without returning ?. The positive
# control (at least one incident-labelled poisoned bead) proves it reads the real count
# rather than asking a question that cannot return a positive answer.
