#   ./test-citations.sh
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS. A test that has never gone red since it was written is either protecting
# something expensive or is dead weight, and nothing about the test says which. citations.sh
# is the mechanism: it reads `# defect:` declarations from suites, queries the database, and
# reports three states — uncited, resolved, and unresolved. The three states must be DISTINCT:
# a suite with no declaration must not read identically to one whose bead is not found, and
# neither must read like one whose bead is found — each calls for a different response, so
# collapsing them hides either a research gap or a mistype (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# A REAL bd ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). The distinction between
# "resolved" and "unresolved" is the database query, and a stub that returns nothing for every
# missing bead would pass the uncited test while silently reporting resolved beads as unresolved.
#
# THE ENVIRONMENT IS EXPLICIT AND MINIMAL. SPIRA_CONF is pointed at a nonexistent file;
# CITATIONS_DIR overrides the directory citations.sh reads, so the suite does not assert
# against the real tree — which changes whenever any test is added or cited — and does not
# write into a real Spira database (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
