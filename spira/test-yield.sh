# test-yield.sh — a gate red lands in the right column, and an unreadable record says `?`.
#
#   ./test-yield.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR. A gate may sit between work and its landings only while it is catching
# real defects (law-gate-earns-its-place). The gate that ran before this one was seventeen
# minutes a branch, found nothing on the morning it mattered, and produced two failures that
# were its own suites reading the state of the box — and it was deleted after twelve hours of
# fallout rather than on that evidence, because nobody was counting. yield.sh is the count.
#
# A COUNT NOBODY CHECKS IS WORSE THAN NO COUNT, because it is believed. The specific way this
# measurement fails is that it silently stops recording: the gate stops calling it, a path
# moves, a verdict field is renamed — and every one of those renders as a tidy, reassuring
# "no gate faults". So every assertion below about a column being empty is preceded by proof
# that the same read finds something when something is there (law-absence-needs-a-positive-
# control), and the `?` cases are asserted as `?` rather than as 0.
#
# DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL gate.sh AGAINST A REAL GIT REPOSITORY. What is under test is a
# classification made from a tree id and an exit status, and a model of either would be a
# second implementation of the thing in question (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). No
# database is needed and none is touched: the gate reaches no beads, so this whole suite is a
# couple of seconds.
#
# THE TWO PLANTED REDS ARE THE POINT, and they differ in exactly one property — whether the
# repository's own gate command also fails against the base. That is the distinction the
# whole metric rests on, and if it ever stops being visible to the gate, both reds land in
# one column and the number stops meaning anything.
