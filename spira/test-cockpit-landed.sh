# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. The "of the N an aeon worked" row was all-time under a
# "24h" header, so comparing it against the 24h closed/opened counts produced nonsense. And
# "never landed" counted every closed bead whose id did not appear in a commit, including
# ones whose branch was still present and queued to land — reporting a healthy landing queue
# as data loss.
#
# THREE STATES, NOT TWO. A closed bead without a commit is awaiting landing if its branch is
# still present, and never landed only when no commit AND no branch carries it. The latter is
# the irrecoverable case the figure exists for, and a false alarm on the former displaces the
# suspicion that would catch a real one (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).

# can replace SPIRA_DB with the fixture. Unset it so conf.sh derives a default with no
# .beads and skips the check. suites.sh also strips it via RUNNER_VARS, but suites run
# directly in a runner context (e.g. for debugging) need this too.
