# test-install-landref.sh — install.sh refuses when the checkout is not on the landref
# or is behind it; SPIRA_INSTALL_FORCE=1 overrides the refusal.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, each with a positive control (the fence MUST fire on the bad case) and
# a negative control (the fence MUST NOT fire when it should not):
#
#   1. WRONG BRANCH: install.sh exits non-zero and names the landref when HEAD is on a
#      branch other than the landref. SPIRA_INSTALL_FORCE=1 suppresses the refusal.
#
#   2. BEHIND LANDREF: install.sh exits non-zero and names the lag when the branch is
#      correct but the checkout is missing commits that are on the remote-tracking ref.
#      SPIRA_INSTALL_FORCE=1 suppresses the refusal.
#
#   3. CLEAN STATE: install.sh does NOT refuse when the checkout is on the landref
#      and fully up to date.
#
# EACH REFUSAL CASE ALSO ASSERTS that no unit file was written to the dest directory.
# The fence fires before any directory creation or file write, so a refusal must leave
# the box exactly as it was.
#
# THE FENCE IS TESTED IN ISOLATION by making watchd.sh a stub (exits 0, no output),
# so the only failure path that can fire before the fence is the path-collision check
# (skipped via SPIRA_CONF=/nonexistent). The fence fires; everything after it would need
# a full systemctl environment and is not what this suite covers.
