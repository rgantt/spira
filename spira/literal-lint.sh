#
# THE PROPERTY. schema.sh is the one file that declares configured label, status and type
# names. A name that appears as a literal in any other source file is a name that can
# disagree with the declaration when an operator changes the default — silently, and at read
# time rather than write time. lib.sh:117 grepped for "needs-ryan" while lib.sh:221 read
# ${SPIRA_ASK_LABEL:-needs-ryan}, and the code default is needs-operator, so on a default
# install the destructive-procedure fence had no bypass at all and every legitimate halting
# bead was refused. One accessor per name makes that class unwritable, because there is no
# literal left to write.
#
# WHICH NAMES. Every value schema_name() returns that is specific enough to be unambiguous:
# compound tokens unlikely to appear as coincidental prose. Short single-word names (plan,
# spike, groom, insight) are excluded because they appear legitimately as English words and
# a fence with a high false-positive rate is a fence everybody learns to ignore.
#
# WHAT IS EXEMPT.
#   schema.sh            — the one file allowed to contain these as literals (the declaration)
#   conf.sh              — operator-facing default assignments (:=) for the env variables
#   literal-lint.sh      — this file; its CONFIGURED_NAMES array IS the pattern list
#   test-literal-lint.sh — its test plants examples for the positive control
#   spira/test-*.sh      — test suites seed fixture databases with specific label values and
#                          must control the schema vocabulary they test against; fixture data
#                          is data, not code
#
# THE ESCAPE. A line or its immediately preceding non-empty line carrying `# literal-ok:
# <reason>` is stood down. The marker belongs beside the code, where the next reader of a
# violation message will look; a config file of exemptions is one that nobody reads when it
# matters. Rewriting the literal to slip past the matcher is the one response that leaves
# neither the literal nor the reason.

# This was a hardcoded array — a literal-lint whose own patterns were literals, copied from
# the declaration it exists to enforce, free to drift from it. Worse, the copy held the code
# DEFAULTS: it guarded "needs-operator" while this host runs SPIRA_ASK_LABEL=needs-ryan, so
# the exact line that motivated the lint — lib.sh:117's grep for "needs-ryan" — and four
# other files sailed through while it reported "clean, 474 files". A fence blind to the
# defect it was built for is worse than no fence, because it reads as covered.
#
# BOTH VALUES ARE GUARDED, never one. A literal is wrong whether it happens to match the
# configured value or the shipped default, and which of the two schema.sh returns depends on
# whether conf.sh found an operator config — which in the gate's minimal environment is not
# something to depend on. Taking the union removes the environment from the question
# entirely (law-schema-over-code: ask the declaration, do not keep a copy).

cat >&2 <<'WHY'

REFUSED by literal-lint.sh — the lines above contain a configured label name as a literal.

The names declared in schema.sh must be read through their accessors everywhere else:

  bash spira/schema.sh name <key>    e.g. schema.sh name ci -> awaiting-ci
  $SPIRA_CI_LABEL                    (set by conf.sh; safe after conf.sh is sourced)

A literal that bypasses these accessors can disagree when an operator changes the default:
lib.sh:117 grepped "needs-ryan" while the code default was needs-operator, so the
destructive-procedure fence never matched on a default install and every legitimate halting
bead was refused.

If the use is genuinely correct — a test seeding a fixture, a Python fallback — say so:

    # literal-ok: <why this line has to>

The annotation must be on the offending line or immediately above it.
WHY
exit 1
