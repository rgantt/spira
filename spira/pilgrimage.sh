#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES
# ------------------
# `gt convoy check` and `gt convoy watch`. A convoy was a durable, NAMED, SUBSCRIBABLE unit
# of batched work. Spira gives up its cross-database tracking for free — one database makes
# that capability meaningless — but the id, the grouping and the subscription have to
# survive, because "Backlog mountain: <repository>" is something you can point at,
# watch, and report on. An epic bead already supplies the id and the grouping through its
# parent/child edges. The subscription is the part that had to be rebuilt, and it is here.
#
# DETECTION IS `bd epic status`, NOT A HAND-ROLLED QUERY
# ------------------------------------------------------
# beads already ships the predicate: `bd epic status --json` reports total_children,
# closed_children and eligible_for_close for every open epic. Reimplementing that as a
# children walk would be the read-the-manual-first mistake.
#
# WHY NOT `bd epic close-eligible`, WHICH SHIPS THE WHOLE ACTION
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Because it takes no label filter, and Spira is a REPLICA until cutover. Measured
#: `bd epic status --eligible-only` returns 13 eligible epics in Spira, every
# one of them imported from Gas Town — four of them —
# whose children Gas Town is still working in its own databases. One unfiltered
# `close-eligible` call would close all 13 here, and the reimport at cutover would then be
# reconciling against a graph this harness had quietly falsified.
#
# The label partition is therefore load-bearing, not a convenience. SPIRA_EPIC_LABELS is
# AND-scoped exactly as the fayth's claim predicate is, so this can only ever act on beads
# that belong to Spira's own plan.
#
# NOTIFY BEFORE CLOSING
# ---------------------
# `bd epic status` reports only OPEN epics, so closing first destroys the evidence that
# the transition happened. Notification is therefore sent first and the close is gated on
# it: if a subscriber cannot be reached, the epic stays open and the next pass retries. A
# subscriber may get the notice twice; nobody gets it zero times. That bias is deliberate —
# silence is the failure mode convoy actually had, with all six convoys stranded and
# nothing saying so.
set -uo pipefail
. "$(dirname "$0")/lib.sh"

# AND-scoped: an epic must carry ALL of these labels to be in Spira's partition.
SPIRA_EPIC_LABELS="${SPIRA_EPIC_LABELS:-spira}"
# The human edge. A completed pilgrimage is an OUTCOME — what happened — so it is emitted as
# `ask.sh note`, a closed `event` bead the panel's NOTIFICATIONS view reads. It used to be
# emitted as `ask.sh insight`, and that was the defect: an insight is what was LEARNED and
# might become law, and two announcements (sp-94h, hq-5enm) sat in that queue as outcomes
# wearing an insight's label because there was only one bin.
# An epic with no explicit watcher still notifies. `gt convoy watch` existed and almost
# nothing ever called it, so completion stayed a capability rather than an event.
# Subscription therefore defaults ON, and `unwatch <epic>` with no address is how you opt
# out. The opt-out is stored as the literal `none` rather than as an absent key, because an
# absent key cannot tell "never subscribed" apart from "deliberately silenced".
# The operator's own address, from the one key that names them, so a clone subscribes its own
# operator rather than somebody else's. It is not the literal `operator` because subscriptions
# already stored carry whatever this installation has always used, and changing the default
# would silence every epic already watched.

# pilgrimage_branches_landed <epic-id> -> 0 if every child's live push-mode branch is
# in landstate as LANDED, 1 (with a log line) if any is not.
#
# THE ASSERTION THIS GUARDS AGAINST: sp-qj8n demonstrated that landing.sh could push and
# merge a branch without writing its LANDED entry to landstate — marker commits lost, the
# branch present in the repo, the bead closed, and the epic then closing over work that
# was never confirmed to have reached the base. The assertion: a branch still present in
# a push-mode repo must carry a LANDED entry. If it does not, the epic is deferred until
# the next landing pass, which either writes the entry or pushes the branch that is somehow
# still there off the base by other means.
#
# WHY ONLY PUSH-MODE REPOS. A pr-mode repo's branches are landed by GitHub, not by
# landing.sh, so there is no landstate entry to check. A hold-mode branch waits for a
# human. Only push-mode branches go through land_mark LANDED, so only those have an entry
# to assert against.
#
# WHY ONLY LIVE BRANCHES. A branch reaped long ago left no trace in the repo. The landing
# that reaped it wrote LANDED to landstate, and a wiped SPIRA_RUN is a legitimate operation
# (landstate is advisory, the database is authoritative). So the absence of a branch from
# the repo is not a problem; the presence of one without a LANDED entry is.
