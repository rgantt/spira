# test-sentinel-capacity.sh — a zero-capacity pass (SPIRA_MAX_AEONS=0) produces a
#   log message distinguishable from a pass that could not read the database;
#   neither reports 'goal reached' when nothing was attempted.
#
#   ./test-sentinel-capacity.sh
#
# WHAT THIS TESTS. When bd cannot reach the database, every state read — open_children,
# plan_ready, plan_inprog — returns 0 or empty, so before sp-4fss both a broken database
# and a finished goal produced the same log line: "pass complete — 0 action(s), 0
# progress, goal reached". The test instance runs at SPIRA_MAX_AEONS=0 permanently,
# which means a broken sentinel is indistinguishable from a working one unless the two
# failure modes produce different output.
#
# ACCEPTANCE (verbatim from sp-4fss):
#   a pass at MAX_AEONS=0 is distinguishable in the log from a pass that could not
#   read the graph; neither reports 'goal reached' when nothing was attempted.
#
# TWO CASES, BOTH SIDES EXERCISED:
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL (DB readable, MAX_AEONS=0, goal reached) — sentinel exits 0,
#      logs "goal reached". Without this, a check that always exits 1 reads as correct.
#   2. DB UNREADABLE — sentinel exits 1, logs "DATABASE UNREADABLE", never "goal reached".
#
# RUN STRATEGY. sentinel.sh is invoked as a subprocess with a minimal environment:
# no real systemd, no real gh, no real network. External scripts (pilgrimage.sh,
# strand.sh, etc.) are stubs that exit 0 and print nothing. The fixture DB carries only
# the goal epic with no open children, so the pass sees 0 open beads and GOAL_REACHED=1.
#
# A REAL bd ON A FIXTURE DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). The DB check this
# suite covers calls bdq (real bd); a stub would prove nothing about whether bd actually
# fails on a bad path.
#
# defect: sp-4fss
# covers: spira/sentinel.sh spira/lib.sh
# hermetic-ok: uses a fixture database; systemd/gh/network reached through SPIRA_LAUNCH,
#   SPIRA_SUMMON and SPIRA_SYSTEMCTL seams which are pointed at stubs
