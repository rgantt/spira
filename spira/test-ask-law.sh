# test-ask-law.sh — ask.sh law files a bead the panel can enact; label, format and body verified.
#
# THE SCAR (labels). Four statute proposals were accepted at 04:11 on 2026-09-10 but nothing
# enacted them — acceptance depended on an agent remembering to run rule.sh by hand. The fix is
# ask-law: the panel runs rule.sh enact itself. But the panel can only do that if the bead
# carries the right labels. A label mismatch is silent at filing time and catastrophic at
# acceptance time. (sp-zumrf)
#
# THE SCAR (body). A law proposal titled with 70 words of statute and no decision line in the
# body caused the operator to answer "yes? this seems good. i don't know what i'm supposed to
# decide here." The body must lead with the decision and its default so the operator knows what
# they are being asked before reading the statute text. (sp-t4506, sp-y73fp)
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST.
#   1. ask.sh law must file a bead with label `ask-law` (panel routing).
#   2. The rendered body must lead with the decision question and a default.
#   3. The statute text must appear in the body (operator can read it without squinting at title).
#   4. ask.sh law without --default still emits a sensible default ("yes — enact it").
#
# PAIRS (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control): every negative assertion is paired with a
# positive one so a broken path that produces nothing still looks like a test failure.
