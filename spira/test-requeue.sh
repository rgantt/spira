#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES. Three attempts poison a bead; a poisoned bead stays OPEN and
# no persona may claim it; and the landing pass lands only a CLOSED bead. So poisoning a
# bead whose work is finished is a permanent deadlock reached by counting — and the counter
# could not tell two opposite endings apart:
#
#   (a) the session ended and the work is not right;
#   (b) the session committed, closed the bead, and the harness reopened it — because the
#       branch no longer rebased onto a base that had moved underneath it.
#
# In (b) the aeon did the work. session_outcome cannot tell them apart — it reads the
# session's own trace, and the trace of a session that committed, closed and ran to its end
# is `unlanded`, the one outcome that charges — so the reopen was charged against the work
# every time round. One bead was charged all eight of its attempts that way over work that
# later landed unchanged; another was poisoned nineteen hours after the session that
# finished it, and its branch merged cleanly the whole time.
#
# EVERY CASE IS A PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). "No attempt was charged" is
# the answer a counter that never runs gives too, so each decline is asserted beside a
# charge that the same code path produces from the same fixture — and the last case runs
# both to the poison threshold, where only the genuine failure arrives.
#
# THE REBASE CONFLICT IS REAL, not simulated by a flag: the base gains a commit touching the
# same line the shim's commit touches, which is what the aeon's own rebase step then fails
# on. A fixture that set the outcome directly would be asserting against a model of the
# thing under test.
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh and attempts.sh against a real bd on a throwaway fixture,
# with a shim standing in for the model (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
#
# strand.sh IS NOT CLAIMED HERE, though it is the counter's second door. Its own classifying
# arms are exercised below through charge_attempt, which is where the decision lives, but the
# script itself is not run — staging a ghost needs an expired lease and a dead holder — and a
# suite that claimed a file it never executes would let the gate believe that file is covered.
