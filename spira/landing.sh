#   landing.sh          one landing pass over every repository
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE SENTINEL ANY MORE
# ----------------------------------------
# The sentinel is a reconcile loop and every other check in it is a handful of bead queries
# and a `git for-each-ref`. Landing is not: it fetches, rebases, runs the repository's whole
# landing gate and pushes. Measured, an ordinary pass took 21s and the one pass
# that landed a branch took 5m30s — and because CHECK 7 (summon an aeon for ready work) sat
# BELOW it, a free aeon slot with 15 beads ready stayed empty for those five and a half
# minutes. systemd will not start a second instance of a oneshot that is already running, so
# the long pass also swallowed the three timer ticks behind it.
#
# That inverts the tenet the harness is built on: cheap deterministic work must not queue
# behind expensive work. Summoning costs about a second and is pure dispatch; gating runs a
# repository's whole test suite. Reordering the two checks was the one-line version and it
# was rejected on purpose — it recovers the free slot but a long landing still swallows the
# ticks behind it, so the loop's period would still be set by its most expensive step.
#
# THE UNIT NAME IS THE MUTEX. The sentinel launches this as a transient unit with a FIXED
# name (`spira-landing`), fire and forget, the same shape lib.sh already uses to summon an
# aeon. systemd refuses to start a unit that is already active, so a pass arriving while a
# landing is still in flight declines and moves on — the wanted behaviour, and it costs no
# lockfile and no pid file to get. `--collect` is load-bearing rather than tidiness: without
# it a FAILED unit stays loaded and every later `systemd-run --unit=spira-landing` would be
# refused forever, which is a landing leg that stops dead and says nothing.
#
# FIRE AND FORGET NEEDS A POSITIVE CONTROL, because "nothing landed" and "the landing worker
# never ran" look identical from the sentinel's pane (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
# So this writes two things the sentinel reads on its next pass:
#
#   landing.status    — key=value, rewritten whole every run: when it finished, its exit
#                       status, how many spira/* branches it actually SAW. A run that saw
#                       branches and landed none is a different fact from a run that saw
#                       none, and a leg that has not completed a run in half an hour is a
#                       third.
#   landing.progress  — an append-only mailbox, one line per movement of the DAG. The
#                       sentinel drains it (by rename, so a line is counted once and only
#                       once) and replays each line through its own `progress`, which is
#                       what keeps landings visible in the sentinel log and counted against
#                       the judgement tier. Landing does not get to count its own actions
#                       into a pass it is no longer part of.

# The cap alone cannot fix that: raising it moves the cliff to wherever the next slow gate is.

# ======================================================================================
# LAND FINISHED BRANCHES. A passing branch must merge without a human; a branch
# that waits rots, because main moves underneath it and manufactures conflicts that did
# not exist.
#
# ONCE PER REPOSITORY, AND HOW A BRANCH LANDS IS THE REPOSITORY'S OWN ANSWER. brain has no
# reviewer between an aeon's commit and origin/main, so its branches are merged and pushed.
# A repository may have branch protection and a CI suite that is the real authority, so pushing
# its default branch would be both wrong and refused; its branches become pull requests with
# auto-merge armed, and GitHub lands them when CI goes green (law-green-prs-merge-themselves).
# A repository whose branches this harness has no business advancing — one whose checkout is a
# Town rig on a detached HEAD — has its branches gated and held.
#
# AND THE BRANCH THEY LAND ON IS THE REPOSITORY'S OWN ANSWER TOO. Three of the seven are not
# `main`: some repositories default to `master` and have no ref named `main` at all, and a
# remote need not be called `origin`. `spira_landref` resolves it and refuses to guess.
# ======================================================================================
# Land in a DEDICATED WORKTREE, never in the shared checkout an interactive session is
# using. The first version guarded on `git status --porcelain` being clean, which fails
# safe in the wrong direction: .claude/concierge.log was a LOG TRACKED IN GIT, rewritten
# every ten minutes by concierge.timer, so the tree was dirty essentially always and the
# gate never opened once. A gate that never opens is as broken as one that never closes.
# The logs are untracked now, but the structural answer is not to care about that tree.
#
# EVERY BRANCH IS REBASED ONTO ITS REPOSITORY'S BASE BEFORE IT IS GATED OR MERGED. A branch
# that was cut hours ago is measured against a base that has moved, and because every Spira bead
# edits the same few files under .claude/spira, the collision is manufactured rather than
# real. Rebasing first turns the merge into a fast-forward and puts any genuine conflict in
# front of an aeon, which can resolve it, instead of in front of a `git merge` that can only
# fail. A merge conflict is not an escalation.

# submitted <id> <tip> [state] — has this exact branch tip already been sent, and how?
#
# `pr` and `hold` leave the branch standing by design, so the plain ancestry test that stops
# `push` mode from re-landing says nothing about them: without this, every pass two minutes
# apart would push the branch again, ask GitHub for the pull request again, and re-note the
# bead again, forever. Keyed on the TIP, so a branch an aeon has moved is genuinely resent.
# A failed submission is retried, but not sooner than an hour — a gh outage must not become
# a request every two minutes, and it must not become silence either.
# =======================================================================================
# D2 — THE PASS REMEMBERS WHAT IT DID.
#
# This pass ran every two minutes and re-derived the entire world each time, keeping nothing.
# So it contradicted its own work: it landed sp-n21 at 21:51:17, reaped the branch a minute
# later, and at 22:00:55 wrote "reopened sp-n21 — does not rebase onto origin/main" about the
# work it had merged nine minutes earlier (sp-q9i). Nine more beads were reopened in one day
# for rebases that were mostly clean, each costing a full Opus session (sp-118). Every one of
# those is a pass with no memory reaching a conclusion its predecessor had already refuted.
#
# ONE FILE PER BEAD, holding the last transition and the commit it was about:
#
#   DONE -> GATED -> REBASED -> LANDED -> SENT
#                 \-> RED      the branch's own failure; reopened ONCE
#                 \-> BLOCKED  needs the operator; never silently retried
#
# THE TIP IS PART OF THE STATE, not just the name. A bead whose branch an aeon has moved is
# genuinely new work and must be re-judged; a bead whose branch has not moved since it was
# landed is the case above, and the state is what says so. Without the tip this would be a
# memory that goes stale silently, which is worse than none.
#
# IT IS AUTHORITATIVE FOR "ALREADY LANDED" AND ADVISORY FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. A recorded
# LANDED forbids a reopen outright, because the alternative — putting merged work back on the
# board — costs an aeon and can revert an amendment. Every other state only lets the pass
# skip work it has already done; if the file is missing, deleted or unreadable, the pass
# behaves exactly as it did before, which is why $SPIRA_RUN can still be wiped at any time.

# THE RECORD IS USED IN TWO WAYS. The first guard written — "do not reopen a commit this
# pass already landed" — was written, then proved UNREACHABLE: a landed tip that has not
# moved is an ancestor of the base, so `content_landed` returns true and the pass never
# reaches the rebase or the gate at all; and a tip that HAS moved is new work, which the
# record correctly declines to vouch for. There is no state in between.
#
# So sp-q9i is NOT fixed here, and shipping that guard would have looked exactly like fixing
# it. Something recreated that ref between the reap and the next pass, and until what did is
# established from the logs rather than guessed at, a guard against it is a guess with a
# comment attached. sp-q9i keeps that question.
#
# THE SECOND USE is the assertion in sending.sh (sp-bjzj). Before it reaps a branch,
# sending.sh checks that landing.sh left a landstate entry for it. An absent entry means
# landing.sh never selected this branch — the selection bug that caused sp-qj8n to close
# four times without the work ever reaching the base. Every code path here writes a record:
# GATED / REBASED / RED / CONTENT / LANDED, so any branch that slips past the loop is
# visible on the first reap rather than after four reopen cycles.
#
# What the record IS for originally: the stretch between DONE and LANDED is invisible, and
# every fact needed to show it is already computed and then dropped (sp-idml). One line per
# bead, written where the transition happens, costs nothing and is the input any analysis
# of that stretch will need.

# =======================================================================================
# A BASE THAT FAILS ITS OWN GATE IS THE REPOSITORY'S BUG, AND IT NEEDS AN OWNER
# =======================================================================================
# BASE_FAIL already costs the branch nothing — no reopen, no attempt. That is the half that
# stops the harm; on its own it also means nothing is ever done about it. A repository whose
# gate is red against its own base refuses EVERY branch of that repository, and the only
# trace was a log line saying the next pass would take it, repeated every two minutes. The
# reopens are gone; the silence that replaced them is the other half of the same defect.
#
# SO THE FINDING GETS AN IDENTITY: one bead, in the builder's partition, labelled with the
# repository whose base is broken. Filed through incident.sh because that intake already
# spools the payload before touching the database, dedupes on an external ref, bumps a
# recurrence instead of filing a second, and escalates once past SIN_AT recurrences — none of
# which is worth a second implementation, and the recurrence count is exactly the signal
# wanted here: a base red for five passes is a base nobody is fixing.
#
# THE REF IS THE REPOSITORY AND THE SUITE, and deliberately not the branch or the bead. Five
# branches blocked by one broken base are one incident, not five; that is the whole meaning
# of "idempotent" here, and a ref carrying either identifier would file one bead per branch
# per pass and rebuild the 300-copy queue the dedupe exists to prevent. The suite comes from
# the gate's own VERDICT line rather than from its prose, so a reworded message cannot
# silently split one incident into two.
#
# IT IS A DEFECT, NOT AN OUTAGE, so the labels are the builder's rather than Ops's: fixing a
# red suite on a base means changing code, and Ops has eight minutes and a runbook.

# A SUBMITTED PULL REQUEST WHOSE BASE HAS MOVED IS DRAGGED BACK ONTO IT.
#
# `pr` mode pushes the branch, opens the pull request and records the tip, and every later
# pass then skips the branch until that tip moves. Nothing moved it. So when the target
# repository's base advances the pull request goes stale, and where a required check tests
# the PR HEAD rather than the merge result it goes red with nobody owning it: the bead is
# closed, the aeon is gone, and Spira has decided it is finished with the branch.
#
# `push` mode never had this. It rebases and merges inside the one pass, so its branch is
# never left standing against a base that can move.
#
# THE PULL REQUEST'S OWN STATE IS ASKED FIRST, and that is not a formality. `gh pr merge
# --squash` lands a NEW commit, so a merged branch is not an ancestor of its base — which
# means the Sending, whose whole predicate is ancestry, never reaps it and it stands here
# forever, further behind with every commit that follows. Without this question every
# merged pull request in the repository would be force-pushed once a pass until its budget
# ran out and then escalated to Ryan as work that would not merge: a page about something
# that finished days ago. A gh that cannot answer is not a licence to rewrite a branch
# either — unreadable is treated as leave it alone.
#
# AND IT IS BOUNDED. A branch refreshed and refreshed that still does not merge is not a
# slow landing, it is a stuck one, and a loop that keeps rebasing it is hiding that rather
# than fixing it. After the cap it is escalated ONCE — the marker's state records that, so
# every later pass is silent — and it stays that way until something moves the branch.
#
# The cap is not a spira.conf key. Nothing about this box's layout sets it; it is a property
# of the mechanism, and the thing an operator tunes is the escalation it produces.

# ======================================================================================
# THE SURVIVORS ARE REBASED THE MOMENT THE BASE MOVES, not when the pass next reaches them.
#
# A landing pass rebases a branch immediately before gating it, so within one turn round the
# loop a branch is always measured against a current base. What it does NOT do is go back:
# a branch this pass has already passed over — most often because the repository's gate tree
# was busy and no verdict was reached — keeps the base it was rebased onto, while the pass
# goes on to land other branches on top of it. It is then stale for as long as it takes the
# next pass to reach it, and every landing in between widens the gap it will have to close:
#
#   20:33  no verdict on <branch> this pass; the next pass takes it      <- rebased, then left
#   ...    five more passes, same answer
#   22:30  reopened <bead> — does not rebase onto the base
#
# Eleven of those in one day and twelve the next, each a finished bead put back on the board
# and a whole agent session spent rebasing. The base had moved under a branch nobody was
# working and nothing brought it forward.
#
# So after a landing, every branch this pass has already judged closed-and-unlanded is
# replayed onto the new base at once. A clean rebase costs a fraction of a second, leaves the
# branch landable on this same pass or the next, and is logged. THIS DOES NOT MAKE A GENUINE
# CONFLICT GO AWAY — a branch and a base that disagree about a file still disagree, and that
# still reopens the bead with the colliding paths named, exactly as before. What it removes is
# the drift a branch accumulates while nothing is looking at it, and it brings the reopen the
# conflict does deserve forward to the landing that caused it, where the note is about one
# commit rather than an hour of them.
#
# THE SET COMES FROM THE LOOP, NOT FROM A FRESH ENUMERATION. Re-deriving it would mean a bead
# query per spira/* ref per landing — after a landing no branch contains the base, so no cheap
# ancestry test filters any of them out — and the loop has already paid for exactly that
# answer. Branches the loop has NOT yet reached need nothing: it rebases each one as it
# arrives at it.
#
# IT IS BOUNDED BY THE LOOP, not by a budget of its own. At worst this replays every survivor
# once per landing, and a survivor is only ever a branch the loop has already gated — so the
# rebases a pass can do this way are bounded by the gates it can do, which the pass budget
# already caps. A clean replay is a fraction of a second; the expensive half of a landing pass
# is the gate, and nothing here runs one.
#
# NEVER UNDER A LIVE AEON, and the check is repeated here rather than inherited from the
# loop. Minutes pass between a branch being judged and a landing that triggers this — a whole
# gate run — and in that window a bead can be reopened elsewhere and claimed. Rewriting
# commits beneath a running aeon destroys work that exists in exactly one place, which is the
# one failure here that nothing can undo.
