#
# build.sh — build the two Rust programs this harness ships.
#
# Loom (the read endpoint over the beads graph) and the cockpit panel (the attention surface)
# are both cargo projects. Nothing in install.sh or elsewhere builds them; a clone that skips
# this script gets a spira-loom.service that exits 2 on every start and an empty attention
# pane.
#
# USAGE
#   build.sh [--with-bd] [--skip-build]
#
#     --with-bd     build bd through build-bd.sh --install after the Rust programs are built.
#                   Requires go and gcc on PATH; see build-bd.sh.
#     --skip-build  skip building entirely — for a container that mounts prebuilt binaries.
#                   Exits 0 after printing the expected paths.
#
# CARGO ABSENT IS A WARNING, NOT A FAILURE. The loop runs without the panel: a machine with
# no cargo installed can still run Spira. When cargo is not found, build.sh names what will
# not work and exits 0 so the rest of the install proceeds.
#
# IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION. cargo build --release is already incremental: a second run on
# an unchanged tree spends a fraction of a second and produces no output. Running build.sh
# twice is safe and cheap.
