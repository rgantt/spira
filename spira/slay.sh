# slay.sh — stop one aeon cleanly and make its bead say what is true.
#
#   slay.sh <bead-id>                      stop it, release the bead (open, unassigned), nuke its work
#   slay.sh <bead-id> --close "<reason>"   ...and close the bead with that reason instead of reopening
#   slay.sh <bead-id> --keep-work          ...but leave its branch and worktree in place
#   slay.sh <bead-id> --why "<text>"       what the note on the bead says the operator's reason was
#
# WHAT "CLEANLY" MEANS, in order, because each step is the one the next depends on:
#   1. A MARKER FIRST, so the aeon's own exit path knows it was slain. aeon.sh charges an
#      attempt on any non-zero exit — a kill is 143 — and three attempts poison a bead. An
#      operator stopping an aeon is not evidence the bead is hard, so the marker makes the
#      exit path release the bead with no attempt charged, the way a spent capacity window
#      already does.
#   2. THE UNIT, NOT THE PID. An aeon is a transient systemd unit with KillMode=control-group,
#      so stopping the unit takes the session, its heartbeat and every child with it. A bare
#      kill of the runner leaves the model session running headless. The pid is the fallback
#      for an aeon that has no unit (a fixture, a hand-run one), and it is matched from the
#      unit's MainPID — never `pkill -f`, which nominates the caller too (law-pgrep-nominates).
#   3. WAIT FOR THE EXIT PATH TO FINISH. The pid file is removed by aeon.sh's own cleanup,
#      after it has released the bead; the pid file going away is the signal that the bead is
#      now ours to set, not a hint that the process is dead.
#   4. THE BEAD SAYS WHAT IS TRUE. Unassigned always — `bd ready --claim` skips an assigned
#      bead while `bd ready` still lists it, which left seven reopened beads unclaimable for
#      hours. Open by default; closed with a reason on request; the `branch:` label comes
#      off with the branch.
#   5. THE WORK, THROUGH lib.sh AND NOWHERE ELSE. Salvage first — a patch of anything
#      uncommitted lands in $SPIRA_RUN/reaped, the same insurance the reaper carries — then
#      the rebase in progress is aborted and spira_destroy_worktree / spira_destroy_branch
#      do the removing, with the tip sha written into the bead's note. Deleted is recoverable
#      from the reflog for a month; a note without the sha is not. Those two primitives are
#      the only permitted callers of `git worktree remove` and `git branch -D` in the
#      harness, and they refuse while anybody is home — which is why step 4's release runs
#      ahead of this rather than after it.
#   6. SAY WHAT WAS DONE, with the evidence, and exit non-zero on anything it could not do.
