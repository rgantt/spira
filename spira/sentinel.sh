#
# THE SHAPE (the operator's call)
# --------------------------------
# "look at the current state, the goal state, reflect on the gap between those states, and
# then take necessary actions to close that gap ... cheap, quick, and frequent to run with
# deterministic heuristics; drop down to inference when judgement is required."
#
# So every check below is a deterministic predicate over beads and the commit graph, and
# each names the single action that closes its gap. Inference is reached only by the LAST
# check, and only when the deterministic ones have all passed and the DAG is nevertheless
# not moving — which is precisely the case where there is no rule to apply, because if
# there were a rule it would already be one of the checks above.
#
# Adding a check is how this system learns: a stall we diagnose by hand once becomes a
# deterministic check, and inference stops being asked about it. Inference is a cost
# centre, not a feature.

# ======================================================================================
# CHECK 6 — land finished branches. THE WORK IS NOT DONE HERE; it is dispatched to
# landing.sh and this pass moves on. Landing fetches, rebases, runs a repository's whole
# gate and pushes: Measured, an ordinary pass cost 21s and the one pass that
# landed cost 5m30s, during which CHECK 7 below could not run and a free aeon slot sat
# empty with 15 beads ready. Cheap deterministic work must not queue behind expensive work,
# and this is the check that made it.
#
# WHY NOT SIMPLY REORDER CHECK 7 ABOVE CHECK 6. It recovers the empty slot and nothing else.
# systemd will not start a second instance of a running oneshot, so a five-minute pass still
# swallows the ticks behind it and the loop's period is still set by its most expensive
# step — which is the actual defect. The decoupling is the fix; the reorder was its shadow.
#
# THE UNIT NAME IS THE MUTEX AND THERE IS NO LOCKFILE. systemd refuses to start a unit that
# is already active, so a pass arriving mid-landing declines and moves on. `--collect` is
# not tidiness: without it a FAILED transient unit stays loaded and every later
# `systemd-run --unit=spira-landing` is refused forever, which is a landing leg that stops
# dead and never says so.
#
# NOTHING IS WAITED ON, so nothing about the landing's outcome is known during this pass.
# What is known is what the PREVIOUS run left behind, and that is read in two places below:
# the mailbox, which carries the movements it made, and the status file, which is the
# positive control — because "nothing landed" and "the landing worker has not run since
# Tuesday" are indistinguishable from here unless the worker says which one it is
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# THE ENVIRONMENT IS EXPLICIT, NOT INHERITED. systemd-run does not carry the caller's
# environment across, which is correct and is also what this must want: a sentinel that
# exported SPIRA_FAYTHS into a transient unit once had it reach a test suite asserting
# defaults, and correct work was rejected on every retry with nothing pointing at the
# environment (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment). Pass what landing.sh needs and
# nothing else — in particular not SPIRA_FAYTHS, which is this pass's business alone.
#
# 40% AND A RuntimeMaxSec, BECAUSE THIS LEAVES THE SENTINEL'S CGROUP. Landing ran under
# spira-sentinel.service's CPUQuota=40% until it was split out; a transient unit is its own
# cgroup, so without a quota of its own the split would quietly hand the box more Spira than
# it had before. 40% is the same ceiling it already had. This machine also runs prod, two CI
# runners and the operator's session, and anything that polls in a loop on it gets a quota before it
# is enabled (law-fence-loops-on-shared-hardware). RuntimeMaxSec is the knob that applies to
# a `simple` service, which is what systemd-run creates; TimeoutStartSec would be ignored.

# queued summoned nothing, and Ops could only ever wake when the builder had work, which is
# backwards for an on-call role. A fayth carries FAYTH_LABELS precisely so its partition is
# its own; the readiness question has to be asked through it.
#
# summon_fayth lives in lib.sh so the decision is one thing in one place — and so it can be

# on-call persona that has to wait behind feature work is not on call.
#
# Ops also RESERVES a slot (FAYTH_RESERVE in its .fayth), which is the half that ordering
# alone cannot do: builders hold their beads for ~10 minutes (p50 9.4 min, p90 18.6 min measured over 28 runs), so a pass that merely asked
# Ops first would still find every slot occupied by sessions that started an hour ago. The
# reserve is subtracted from what the others may see whether or not Ops is using it.
#
# A HOST THAT SETS NO POOL BEHAVES EXACTLY AS BEFORE — an empty pool is passed as empty, and

# their own units; only task personas are called for a fight and dismissed after it, and only

#      builder matched the partition but was excluded by the preference; ops was excluded
#      by its own partition. Every persona reported 0; every report was truthful.
#   2. spira with no partition label — a bead any partition requires exactly one of (plan,
#      incident, ...) but carries none of them; invisible to every persona by construction.
#      Live instance at time of fix: sp-bvo7.
