# test-groomer.sh — groomer.sh: graph hygiene operations and the unwanted-close refusal.
#
#   ./test-groomer.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS GUARDING
# ---------------------------
# groomer.sh provides four hygiene operations (supersede, close, correct-lane, and the
# composable split/merge that aeons do via bd create + supersede). The central property this
# suite enforces is the one the bead makes a hard requirement: groomer.sh REFUSES to close a
# bead as unwanted, and that refusal is in the code, not a sentence in a brief.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control)
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The unwanted refusal is tested by CALLING it and requiring the exit code to be 2 and the
# output to contain the word "REFUSED". A check that only tests the success cases proves
# nothing about the refusal — a missing case handler that falls through to "usage" (exit 1)
# would pass every success case. The positive control for the refusal IS the refusal: plant
# the offender, require the matcher to say so, then believe it when it is silent.
#
# STUB BD (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment)
# ----------------------------------------------
# groomer.sh calls bd for its side effects. A real bd call would require a live Dolt server
# and a seeded database, and would test bd as much as groomer.sh. Instead, SPIRA_BD is set
# to a stub that records its argv to a file and exits 0. The stub proves groomer.sh passed
# the right arguments; bd's own correctness is tested in suites that use testdb.sh.
