# test-testenv-scratch.sh — testenv.sh scratch and shell deliver a working throwaway database.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS COVERS. An aeon working on a harness script ran the script against
# $SPIRA_DB (production) because no cheaper path existed. testenv.sh scratch gives a real
# bd database in one command without requiring a suite or the podman container; testenv.sh
# shell drops into a subshell where every harness command is aimed at the fixture.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL FIRST. Before asserting that scratch produces a working database, this
# suite verifies that bd REJECTS a plain temp directory — so a scratch that printed a path
# but didn't initialise it would cause these assertions to fail. Without that check, "it
# printed a path" and "the path is a database" are indistinguishable
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# PRODUCTION ISOLATION. The suite records the production bead count before and after
# running scratch, and asserts they are equal. scratch must create a NEW database; it must
# not write to whatever SPIRA_DB was set in the environment.
#
# covers: spira/testenv.sh spira/testdb.sh

# never captured from stderr (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).

# TMP; (2) replace the EXIT trap with a no-op so teardown is deliberately skipped.
