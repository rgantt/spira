# test-reclaim-escalated.sh — end-to-end: an escalated bead (IN_PROGRESS, waiting on an
#   unanswered operator ask dep) is not reclaimed by either the time-based reaper (CHECK 2)
#   or the ghost check (CHECK 2b).
#
#   ./test-reclaim-escalated.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-9zpm: sp-mfa4 (IN_PROGRESS, waiting on sp-rmnw, an unanswered
#   needs-ryan ask) was reclaimed six times — the time-based reaper and the /proc ghost
#   check each treated it as a dead worker. Two fixes closed both paths:
#     - sp-rzyl: check2_protect_waiting applies SPIRA_RECLAIM_SKIP_LABEL to a work bead
#       whose only open dep carries the ask label; bdq reclaim --exclude-label skips it.
#     - sp-qsa1: strand-classify.py exempts beads carrying either the ask or skip label
#       from ghost classification.
#
#   test-check2-reclaim.sh verifies the skip label is applied/removed by protect_waiting.
#   test-reclaim-needs-ryan.sh verifies strand-classify.py respects the labels in isolation.
#   THIS TEST verifies the chain end-to-end: protect_waiting labels the bead in the real
#   database, the label is present in the data extracted from the database and fed to the
#   ghost check, and the ghost check does not raise ghost for the labeled bead.
#
# FOUR CASES (all sides exercised — law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL: a plain dead-worker bead (no labels, expired lease) IS ghost.
#      Without this, a broken ghost classifier that never fires passes silently.
#
#   2. CHAIN — BEFORE PROTECTION: work bead has expired lease + ask dep, but protect_waiting
#      has not run yet (no SKIP label on the bead). Ghost IS raised — proving the fix was
#      necessary and the positive control is asserting the right thing.
#
#   3. CHAIN — PROTECTED: protect_waiting applies SKIP to the work bead (the ask dep is
#      still open). The same bead, re-extracted from the real database, is NOT ghost. This
#      is the core assertion: the real-database label from protect_waiting propagates
#      correctly through to the ghost-check input.
#
#   4. CHAIN — AFTER ANSWER: the ask dep closes. protect_waiting removes SKIP. The bead,
#      re-extracted, IS ghost again — confirming the protection is lifted once an answer
#      arrives and the bead is returned to the reaper for normal reclaim.
#
# CASE 1: fixture file only (no database) — fast isolation of the ghost classifier.
# CASES 2–4: real fixture database (testdb.sh) for protect_waiting, JSON extracted from the
#   database and fed to strand-classify.py. A past lease is injected into the extracted JSON
#   so the time condition in the ghost check fires; the rest of the data is live from the DB.
