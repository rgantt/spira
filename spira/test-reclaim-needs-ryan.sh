# test-reclaim-needs-ryan.sh — strand-classify.py's ghost check skips IN_PROGRESS beads
#   that carry the ask label (needs-ryan) or the reclaim-skip label (spira-waiting-operator),
#   and still fires for a plain dead-worker bead.
#
#   ./test-reclaim-needs-ryan.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-2k5a: the sentinel's CHECK 2 reclaim cadence re-summoned an IN_PROGRESS
# bead (sp-mfa4) six times while it was correctly waiting on an unanswered needs-ryan ask
# (sp-rmnw). The fix for the time-based reaper (sp-rzyl / check2_protect_waiting) applied
# spira-waiting-operator to such beads so the sentinel's --exclude-label flag skipped them.
# But strand-classify.py's ghost case — the /proc-based, faster-acting reaper in CHECK 2b —
# had no equivalent exclusion: it classified ANY in_progress bead with an expired lease as
# a ghost and handed it to `bd reclaim`, bypassing the protection.
#
# THREE CASES, ALL SIDES EXERCISED (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL (plain dead worker) — ghost IS raised.
#      Without this, an implementation that never raises ghost reads as correct.
#
#   2. PROTECTED (ask label — needs-operator directly on the bead) — ghost NOT raised.
#      The bead is legitimately waiting for an operator decision. Reclaiming it re-summons
#      an aeon that immediately re-derives the same diagnosis (sp-2k5a replay).
#
#   3. PROTECTED (skip label — spira-waiting-operator applied by check2_protect_waiting) —
#      ghost NOT raised. check2_protect_waiting shields beads whose only open dep carries
#      the ask label; the ghost check must honour the same shield.
#
# EXERCISED VIA FIXTURE FILES, not a live database. strand-classify.py reads BEADS_FILE
# and READY_FILE; the classifier is what is under test, and the DB-to-JSON representation
# is a separate seam verified by test-check2-reclaim / test-check5-drop.
