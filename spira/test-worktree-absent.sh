# test-worktree-absent.sh — spira_destroy_worktree prunes a registry entry whose
# directory is gone, even when the path is outside SPIRA_RUN/worktree.
#
#   ./test-worktree-absent.sh
#
# THE BUG (sp-hl92). The reaper refused to remove a registered worktree whose path
# was outside the sanctioned root — the fence ran before the absent-directory check,
# so a /tmp-style gate worktree whose session had ended could never be cleared.
# sentinel.log accrued "was not removed" on every Sending pass, permanently, because
# the gap between "not under the root" and "directory does not exist" had no code path.
#
# THE FIX. The absent-directory check now runs before the fence. git worktree prune
# is a registry-only operation — it touches nothing on disk — so it is safe regardless
# of where the path points. The fence still guards the rm -rf path for existing paths.
#
# THE PROPERTIES UNDER TEST.
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL. Register an out-of-root worktree, verify it is registered,
#      then verify spira_destroy_worktree returns 0 and the entry is gone.
#      Without this, silence from the function is indistinguishable from it being
#      pointed at a wrong fixture (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
#   2. A DIRECTORY THAT EXISTS outside the root is still REFUSED. This is the fence
#      the bead preserves: a misconfigured caller must not rm -rf an arbitrary path.
#
# NO DATABASE. spira_destroy_worktree does not call bd; it only touches the git
# registry and the filesystem. A git fixture with a real repo is the right dependency
# (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
