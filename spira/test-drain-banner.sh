# test-drain-banner.sh — health.sh renders a drained world as a firing condition.
#
#   ./test-drain-banner.sh
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. On 2026-09-08 the session armed world.sh drain for a safe install
# and left it armed for ~13 minutes. world.sh status DID report DRAINING, but nothing put
# that in front of the operator — so a pool held at zero by design looked identical to a pool
# that is simply idle. The drain banner is the mechanism that makes those two states
# distinguishable from the health pane (per Ryan, 2026-09-08, sp-v7ok).
#
# WHAT THIS TESTS. cockpit/health.sh's drain_banner function:
#   - shows a DRAINING banner when $SPIRA_RUN/world.draining exists
#   - includes the minutes since the stamp was written (from stat mtime)
#   - renders `?` when the stamp exists but mtime cannot be read
#   - shows nothing when the stamp does not exist
#   - does not confuse drain with halt
#
# THE FIXTURE IS A STAMP FILE, not a mock world.sh. world.sh status reads systemd unit
# names (which are broken, sp-4biz), while drain/resume gate on the stamp file directly.
# The test does the same: plant the stamp, check the pane, remove it, check again.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Before asserting that
# drain is invisible when absent, this suite proves it is visible when present — otherwise
# a renderer that never shows the banner passes all absence assertions.
#
# No database, no network, under a second.
