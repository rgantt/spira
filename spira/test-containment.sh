# test-containment.sh — a non-prod instance refuses repos outside its workspaces root
# and repos whose git remote is network-reachable.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE COVERS
# ----------------------
# Containment is two independent refusals, both failing closed, for SPIRA_INSTANCE != prod:
#
#   1. Any repo-map path not under SPIRA_WORKSPACES is refused by name.
#   2. Any repo-map path whose git remote resolves to a network URL is refused.
#
# Prod is entirely unaffected: neither check runs when SPIRA_INSTANCE is 'prod' (or
# absent), so the seven real repos load unchanged.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST. Before asserting that a bad config is refused, prove
# that a good one passes: a test-instance map with local paths and no remotes must load
# without error. Silence on a check that was never reached looks identical to a check that
# passed; the positive control is the only thing that distinguishes them.
#
# ACCEPTANCE (from bead sp-g2vl):
#   A — a test config naming a path outside SPIRA_WORKSPACES is refused by name.
#   B — a test clone that still has a real origin is refused.
#   C — a prod config with the (example) repos loads unchanged.
#
