# test-cross-repo.sh — an aeon working a bead for a non-home repo cuts its worktree in
#   the right checkout, and commits land in that repo's history, not the home repo's.
#
#   ./test-cross-repo.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS. FAYTH_REPO was a constant per fayth, and every fayth in the
# chamber pointed at the home checkout. So a bead labeled repo:widget had no aeon that
# could open the file — the workspace was always the home repo, regardless of which
# repository the bead named. This is the integration test that proves the whole cross-repo
# flow works: bead -> repo: label -> repo-map -> second repo's worktree -> commit in second
# repo's history.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, EACH A PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. The worktree is cut in the SECOND repo, not the home repo. Without a positive
#      control showing the commit lands in second but NOT in home, a check that always
#      used the home repo would be indistinguishable from one that is correct.
#
#   2. The worktree PATH is inside the second repo's object store: the work directory is a
#      worktree of second, not a worktree of home. A cross-repo path that shared home's
#      object store would silently put work on a branch that could never land in second.
#
#   3. The aeon log records the correct repo name. The log is what the operator reads when
#      diagnosing a stalled bead, so an incorrect record there misleads the diagnosis.
#
# TWO REPOS, because the property this test exists to prove is about the DIFFERENCE between
# them. A single-repo fixture proves nothing: the home repo IS the correct repo.
#
# A REAL bd ON A FIXTURE DATABASE, a shim for claude (via SPIRA_CLAUDE), and real git repos
# with remotes — the claim is about worktree creation and commit ancestry, and a stub of
# either would be a second implementation of the thing in question.
#
