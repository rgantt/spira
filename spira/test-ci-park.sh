#
# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. `$SPIRA_CI_LABEL` means "parked on a run somebody else
# is watching". It is excluded from every persona's predicate AND from the stalled-work
# report, which is the point of it — parked work must not look abandoned — and is exactly
# what makes a park nothing can end strictly worse than a stall: not claimable, not
# reported, and rendered to the operator as "in CI", the one description that stops anybody
# looking for the real cause. One bead reached 22 reclaims that way, not one of them a work
# failure, while the board said it was in CI and the repository it named opens no pull
# requests at all.
#
# Only `pr` mode opens one. `push` merges the branch itself and `hold` leaves it for a
# human, so for both of those the landing gate IS the gate and there is nothing further to
# wait for. Two ways to get it wrong, and the harness closes both: parking such a bead at
# all, and leaving a park standing when the bead MOVED repository afterwards — which no
# check made at the moment of parking could have seen.
#
# WHY EVERY CASE HERE IS A PAIR. Each of these mechanisms fails by doing nothing, and doing
# nothing is what a healthy pipeline also looks like: a classifier that answered `no-ci` to
# everything would block any gate from being created where no run can resolve it, and one
# that answered `watch` to everything would gate every bead including those with no run.
# So the same input is driven both ways round wherever a verdict is asserted
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# THE DEADLINE IS PINNED TO A NON-DEFAULT, 600 rather than the shipped 5400. Asserting
# against the shipped value passes just as well if the number is written into the code,
# which is the thing the configuration key exists to stop.

# The gate-check sweep resolves gates for pr-mode repos; the brief is what stops a gate
# being created where nothing can resolve it — a push or hold bead told to create a gh:run
# gate would sit gated forever, invisible, while the pane said "in CI".
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh with a shim standing where the model would be, capturing
# the prompt it was actually handed. A structural grep over aeon.sh would assert that both
# branches are written; only running it asserts that the right one is reached, which is the
# half that can break — REPO_LAND comes from the bead's `repo:` label through the map, and a
# lookup that answered nothing would silently give every aeon the `push` brief.
