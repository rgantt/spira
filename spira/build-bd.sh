#
# WHY NOT npm, WHICH IS WHERE bd-embedded CAME FROM
# --------------------------------------------------
# `npm install -g @beads/bd` serves v1.2.2 as `latest`. v1.2.2 IS NOT A SUCCESSOR TO v1.2.1:
#
#     git merge-base v1.2.1 v1.2.2  ->  8e4e59d39 (2026-07-03, "refresh MCP lock for v1.1.0")
#     git merge-base --is-ancestor v1.2.1 v1.2.2  ->  false
#
# It was cut from a branch that forked at v1.1.0 in early July and never took the v1.2.0/v1.2.1
# work. Its highest migration is 0053 against v1.2.1's 0065, and it has NONE of unclaim,
# reclaim, heartbeat, sync, schema or conflicts. The version string gives no hint: the newer
# number is the older code.
#
# That one fact caused both bd outages here. On 2026-09-09 aeon.sh put that binary on live
# aeons' PATH; against the production store (v61) it printed "schema version mismatch … binary
# knows up to v53" WHILE EXITING 0, and four aeons escalated a destructive rollback of 3,296
# healthy beads. On 2026-09-10 test-attempts.sh ran its fixture on it, `bd unclaim` printed
# "unknown command", and gate-spira.sh went red against a clean origin/main — nothing landed
# for hours. Neither was embedded mode's fault. Both were "install the latest release".
#
# WHY BOTH BUILD FLAGS
# --------------------
#   CGO_ENABLED=1      embedded Dolt is opened through cgo. A CGO_ENABLED=0 binary REFUSES at
#                      runtime — "embedded Dolt requires a CGO build" — however it is tagged.
#                      Confirmed by building one and watching it refuse.
#   -tags gms_pure_go  go-mysql-server links ICU under cgo, so a bare CGO_ENABLED=1 build dies
#                      at the C linker on unicode/uregex.h. `make doctor-build` names the pair.
# Neither alone works. Both were got wrong once each on 2026-09-10.
