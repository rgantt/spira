#
# WHAT THIS SUITE COVERS
# ----------------------
# sp-4biz (2026-09-08): TIMERS held the plain unit names (spira-sentinel.timer, etc.)
# while the per-instance migration (sp-trn1) renamed the live units to
# spira-sentinel-prod.timer. systemctl stop exits 0 against a disabled unit, so
# world.sh stop printed "stopped spira-sentinel.timer" while the live timer kept firing.
# The loop re-summoned aeons within two minutes of a "successful" halt.
#
# TWO PROPERTIES, each verified under BOTH naming schemes:
#
#   1. stop targets the RESOLVED sentinel timer — the one that is enabled or active —
#      confirmed by reading the call log, not by stop's exit code. A test that asserts
#      on exit code passes while leaving the sentinel running (systemctl stop exits 0
#      for a disabled unit, which is exactly what hid the original defect).
#
#   2. status reports the state of the RESOLVED timer, not a hardcoded plain name.
#      Before the fix, status read spira-sentinel.timer (inactive) while
#      spira-sentinel-prod.timer was active.
#
# TWO SCENARIOS per property:
#   A: post-migration — instance-qualified unit is enabled/active (spira-sentinel-prod.timer)
#   B: pre-migration fallback — instance-qualified not enabled; plain name is active
#
# ADDITIONALLY: --hard stop under both naming schemes for watcher units.
#   The rename replaced spira-watch@<name>.service (template instance) with
#   spira-watch-<name>-<instance>.service (plain per-instance). world.sh --hard must
#   find and stop whichever form is running.
#
# systemctl IS STUBBED throughout. Assertions are on what world.sh ASKED systemd to do.
#

# covers: spira/world.sh
