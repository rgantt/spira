# test-suites-fixture-fault.sh — a shared-fixture collapse files one bead, not one per borrower.
#
#   ./test-suites-fixture-fault.sh
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST. When the shared fixture that suites.sh builds at the top of
# each pass fails to reset inside a borrower suite, that borrower exits with
# TESTDB_FAULT_EXIT (75) rather than a suite-failure code. suites.sh must classify that
# as a pass-level fixture fault and file exactly one bead naming all affected suites,
# not one bead per borrower. A borrower that cannot get a fixture is not a red suite.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS ENDS. The 02:34-03:05 pass filed five separate beads for one fixture
# collapse. Five workers were each summoned onto a bead whose suite passes individually,
# each closed it as unreproducible, and the real finding — that the shared fixture failed
# mid-pass — appeared in none of them. The operator saw five separate regressions in
# five suites and spent half a day ruling them out one by one (sp-n0xj7).
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL: three borrower suites exit 75 (fixture fault) and one suite exits 1
# (a genuine red). The pass must file exactly one fixture-fault bead (not three) and
# exactly one red bead (for the genuine failure). Total beads filed: two. Not four.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: with no shared fixture built by the pass (_td_shared=0), a suite that
# exits 75 is treated as a red, not a fixture fault. TESTDB_FAULT_EXIT is a shared-fixture
# protocol; outside that context it is an ordinary non-zero exit code.
#
# SPIRA_DB RESTORE: with testdb_up forced to fail, suites.sh's production SPIRA_DB must
# still point at the outer database after the fixture block.
