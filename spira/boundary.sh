#   boundary.sh render          the table, to stdout

#
# WHY A RENDERER AND NOT TWO HAND-KEPT TABLES. A boundary documented on only one side of
# itself is not a boundary. The shape of the failure is already on the record here: the
# cockpit's shell tools were pointed at one database while the panel still wrote to another,
# and within the hour a conversation was split across two stores and an answer reached
# nobody. Two copies of an ownership table drift the same way and just as quietly, so there
# is one source — `boundary` — and both documents carry a generated region.
#
# REGENERATED WHOLE, NEVER PATCHED. Editing a marker region does nothing: the next run
# overwrites it, and `check` fails the gate in the meantime. Amend `boundary` instead.
#
# THE WIKI TARGET IS OPTIONAL, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This file ships with the harness, and
# the harness must start from a clean clone with no wiki anywhere on the machine — rule 2 of
# the boundary it renders. A missing wiki page is skipped in silence; a missing README is an
# error, because that one is the harness's own.
