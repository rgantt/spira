# test-sentinel.sh — land_escalate does not ask twice while an ask is already open;
#   a CLOSED ask does not suppress a new one.
#
#   ./test-sentinel.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. land_escalate was rate limited on a clock, so nine identical "Spira is
# landing nothing" decisions reached the operator's pane in one day. He closed eight and the
# ninth arrived anyway. The fix asks the database rather than a clock: ask_already_open finds
# an OPEN bead with the subject and returns 0, which suppresses the re-ask. This suite asserts
# both sides of that check:
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — no open ask: land_escalate reaches the operator. Without this, a
#      suppression that mutes everything is indistinguishable from one that mutes correctly.
#
#   2. OPEN-ASK SUPPRESSION — an open bead with the subject suppresses the re-ask. The
#      fixture seeds the bead explicitly; an empty database passes for the wrong reason.
#
#   3. CLOSED-ASK PASS-THROUGH — a CLOSED ask is an answered question. The same condition
#      recurring after an answer is new information (law-alerts-must-be-actionable), so a
#      closed ask must NOT suppress a new escalation. This is the half that regresses
#      silently: without it, an ask closed by the operator becomes a permanent mute button.
#
# A REAL bd ON A FIXTURE DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). ask_already_open queries
# the database for open beads; a stub would reproduce the surface remembered here, drift
# silently, and prove nothing about the real suppression path.
