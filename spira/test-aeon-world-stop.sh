# test-aeon-world-stop.sh — the world-stop fence in aeon.sh refuses a world-stop bead
# when live aeons are present, and calls world.sh stop/start when they are not.
#
#   ./test-aeon-world-stop.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE COVERS
# ----------------------
# A bead labelled world-stop (SPIRA_WORLD_STOP_LABEL) declares it needs the world halted
# while it runs. The fence in aeon.sh enforces this: if live aeons exist, it refuses the
# claim rather than letting a session run world.sh stop under them. The near-miss this
# closes: sp-6ylz had "needs the world stopped" in its title, was dispatchable anyway,
# and an aeon ran world.sh stop with live aeons running, producing a three-minute write
# outage. (sp-ynvd)
#
# FOUR PROPERTIES, each a pair (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. A bead WITHOUT the world-stop label is claimed and worked normally — no fence fires.
#
#   2. A bead WITH the world-stop label and live aeons present is REFUSED: the claim is
#      released, the refusal message names the override (SPIRA_WORLD_STOP_SKIP) and the
#      live aeon by pidfile name, and world.sh is never called.
#
#   3. A bead WITH the world-stop label and NO live aeons calls world.sh stop before the
#      session and world.sh start after — confirmed by reading the call log, not by asking
#      the real systemd.
#
#   4. With SPIRA_WORLD_STOP_SKIP=1 set (the named override), the fence proceeds even with
#      live aeons present — world.sh stop is still called.
#
# world.sh IS STUBBED so no real systemd units are touched. The stub records every
# positional argument world.sh receives, one call per line. A live-aeon scenario uses a
# REAL background process so /proc scanning produces a live pid.
#
# defect: sp-ynvd
# covers: spira/aeon.sh spira/world.sh spira/conf.sh
