#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# An aeon works in a worktree of the shared checkout on its own branch. If it cd-s back
# to the shared checkout and commits there, the commit lands on the base branch — bypassing
# its worktree branch, the landing gate, and every instrument that reads refs/heads/spira/*:
# the landing check, the Sending, and the unsent count are all blind to it.
#
# The path that produces the defect: aeon.sh sets the worktree at $SPIRA_RUN/worktree/$BEAD_ID
# and cd-s into it. An aeon that ran `git commit` in its worktree would have committed on its
# own branch, as intended. One that `cd`-ed out of the worktree back to the shared $REPO and
# committed there landed on whatever branch the shared checkout had, typically the base branch.
# Nothing in the commit path at that point knew it was wrong.
#
# A FENCE, NOT A WALL. Ryan and the brain session commit to the shared checkout directly on
# purpose — the base branch has many operator commits in its history. The aeon identity is
# what makes a commit wrong here, not the path it arrived through. An aeon's committer email
# is always "aeon-<name>@spira.local", set by aeon.sh; that suffix is the discriminator, and
# it is one that no human on this box carries.
#
# THE OVERRIDE is "git commit --no-verify", which git already provides and which there is
# no point pretending to take away. The fence that survives --no-verify is the landing gate,
# which runs inventory.sh and hermetic.sh on every branch.

# email address that does not end in @spira.local, so the check is a single glob test.
