# test-verify-asks.sh — asks with a passing VERIFY check are closed by verify-asks.sh.
#
#   ./test-verify-asks.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# An operator ask can carry a read-only shell command that proves the work is already
# done. verify-asks.sh runs those commands unattended, and closes the ones that pass.
# Five properties are load-bearing and verified here:
#
#   1. A VERIFY check exiting 0 → verify-asks.sh closes the ask (with --apply).
#   2. A VERIFY check exiting non-zero → ask stays open.
#   3. An ask without VERIFY is never touched.
#   4. Without --apply the sweep reports but does not close.
#   5. A mislabelled epic (escalation label on an epic issue type) is reported.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS FIRST. Before asserting that a passing check closes an ask,
# the suite verifies the bead is STILL OPEN before the sweep runs. A bead already
# closed would produce the same "closed" output and every assertion below would pass
# on fiction.
#
# SPIRA_ASK_LABEL IS PINNED TO A NON-DEFAULT to prevent a hardcoded literal in the
# parser from satisfying these assertions without exercising the key
# (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment). Both ask.sh (which writes the label) and
# verify-asks.sh (which reads it) source conf.sh, which honours the exported value.
