#   gate-spira.sh
#
# THE PRODUCTION LANDING GATE IS NOT THIS SCRIPT. The landing gate for this repository is
# the CMD in the repo-map (the fence scripts run directly). This script is invoked by
# suites.sh on a timer; when it is red it files a bead, but it does not block landings.
# A branch lands when the repo-map CMD passes, not when this script passes. Being red here
# is a fact for the timed run and for whoever can fix the failing suite — not for the gate.
# Decision: sp-wyep. Scar: gate-spira.sh was red at 16:33 UTC 2026-09-12 while nineteen
# commits landed unimpeded; the mechanism is that the landing gate is the fence CMD, not
# this script (sp-50l).
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACED, and why. Until 2026-09-07 this ran 43 suites, 13,098 lines of test
# code against 4,642 lines of program, and took 17 minutes per branch. On the day the system
# spent an entire morning unable to land anything, that gate found zero real defects and
# produced two failures — both of them suites reading the state of the box they ran on rather
# than the code under test. It was also, by being 17 minutes long, most of the contention
# that made a shared worktree worth locking, and the lock is what livelocked the queue.
#
# The three real defects that day were found by two things: tests written for the specific
# change, in minutes, and a 20-second soak. Neither was in the 17 minutes.
#
# WHAT THIS SYSTEM ACTUALLY IS: N workers pull from a DAG, put candidate work in a merge
# queue, and the queue is CI/CD. Every failure it has ever had is a property of that pipeline
# — two things running at once, a lock, a queue that stops moving — and none has been a
# function returning the wrong value. So the gate checks the pipeline.
#
#   1. THE FENCES. Not quality checks: guards against things that cannot be undone by
#      deleting a commit. A published beads database holds internal notes, agent memories and
#      the operator's own judgement; a published operator inventory names one person's
#      machine. The third is undone by a revert and is here for a different reason: a suite
#      that reads the state of the box refuses correct work with nothing in its output
#      pointing anywhere but at the branch, and both failures the deleted 17 minutes produced
#      on its last day were that. These run first, independently, and nothing routes around
#      them.
#   2. THE SOAK. Does the merge queue make progress while several gates and a landing pass
#      run against each other? It reproduces the 2026-09-07 livelock against the old code at
#      the production ratio, then shows it gone.
#   3. THE END-TO-END is filed, not built (sp-canary). One bead through the whole pipeline
#      on a staging Spira, with a commit on the base branch at the end of it, is the only
#      check that would test the claim this system makes about itself — and it needs a whole
#      second Spira stood up, which is not what today is for. Detection comes first
#      (law-detection-outranks-rejection): the watchtower notices the pipeline has stopped
#      and files it back into the DAG, which is worth more than a gate refusing a change.
#
# It fails CLOSED, and a check that could not run is not a pass.

# IT JUDGES THE TREE IT IS PART OF, and it finds that tree from its own path. This read
# `cd "${SPIRA_GATE_REPO:-.}"`, and the gate sets SPIRA_GATE_REPO to the INSTALLED CHECKOUT
# while extracting the branch to a scratch worktree and running the command there — so this
# line stepped out of the tree under trial and ran the installed copy's suites instead. Every
# branch was therefore judged against the code already in force, which is the one failure a
# gate must not have: it passes work it never looked at, and the landing pass acts on the
# pass. A branch that only edits existing files sails through on the installed copy's green.
# It surfaced only when a branch ADDED a suite, which the installed copy did not have.
#
# Self-located rather than configured, because where the harness IS is a fact about where

The gate has run longer than SPIRA_GATE_BUDGET. Before adding any suite to
spira/gate-suites, one must leave: the budget is what forces that argument, and without
it each suite was individually justified while the total reached 17 minutes unchecked.

# FIXTURE CONTAMINATION FENCE. A production store that contains test-only beads means a
# test wrote to the live database instead of an isolated fixture. Two markers identify
# test-only beads unambiguously:
#
#   external_ref of the form "fixture-fault:<name>" where <name> does not start with
#   "sptest_": real fixture-fault beads from suites.sh carry TESTDB_NAMEs of the form
#   sptest_<tag>_<epoch>_<pid>; a name without that prefix is a literal tag from test code
#   (e.g. "test_fixture") that never appears in operational data.
#
#   description exactly "Test payload" (after trimming whitespace): the literal placeholder
#   string test code uses to avoid writing meaningful content into fixture beads.
#
# The fence is skipped when SPIRA_DB is not set or does not point at an existing database
# directory — normal in test environments that supply a nonexistent path to isolate
# themselves from the live store. When the database is present but bd cannot query it, the
# failure is logged and the fence skips: inability to read is not evidence of contamination,
# and refusing to land because the database is temporarily unreachable is a different kind
# of wrong (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).
