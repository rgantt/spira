# displaying the DISCARDED session's context until something is next said, which means the
# instrument that exists to say whether clearing was worth doing reports that the clear did not
# work. Every other state this feature renders — sweeping, archiving, safe to clear — likewise
# changes while the session is IDLE, which is the definition of background work: with no timer

# `systemctl list-unit-files` then shows two units claiming the same service.
