#
#   gate.sh <branch> [repo-name]
#
# This is the Cloister: a trial a branch passes before it may enter. It is deliberately
# cheap and mechanical — syntax, then whatever the repository itself declares — because a
# gate that needs judgement is not a gate, it is a review. Judgement belongs to sentinel.sh
# CHECK 8 and to the operator.
#
# TWO LAYERS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS UNIVERSAL. `bash -n` on every changed shell script
# holds everywhere, because a script that does not parse is the most common way an
# unattended change breaks a harness. Everything else is the REPOSITORY'S OWN: brain runs
# the harness and guard suites, another runs a Rust formatting check with its own CI
# behind the pull request. That command comes from repo-map, so adding a repository is
# adding a line rather than editing this file — which is what "the landing gate must learn
# each repo's own test command" means in practice.
#
# It fails CLOSED. A gate that cannot run its own checks must not report a pass: the whole
# point is to keep unverified work out of a branch everything else pulls from.
#
# FAILING CLOSED IS NOT THE SAME AS BLAMING THE BRANCH, and conflating them is what this gate
# spent two days doing. Every exit here is one of four outcomes (conf.sh): PASS, FAIL,
# BASE_FAIL, NO_VERDICT. The verdict is withheld identically in the last two — nothing lands
# — but only FAIL says the branch is at fault, and only FAIL may cost it an attempt. Before
# this, a missing worktree, a lock, a deadline and a repository whose suites fail on its own
# base all arrived at the landing pass as "this branch is broken", and three of those poison
# a bead and page the operator about work that was fine.

# invariant that cannot be left to the caller: a FAIL must be able to show its work.
#

# D1 — THE VERDICT IS COMPUTED ONCE AND KEYED BY WHAT IT JUDGED.
#
# Every bead paid this gate at least twice: the aeon runs it before it closes, and the
# landing pass runs it again, on the same tree, minutes later. Measured across 51 sessions,
# 150 aeon runs; each full spira gate is 380-620s, and 1860s on one occasion. That is the
# whole of the DONE-to-LANDED latency and most of the contention that made a shared tree
# worth locking in the first place (sp-0v8).
#
# THE KEY IS THE QUESTION, NOT THE ASKER. Nothing before this identified a verdict at all,
# so nothing could be reused; gate-run.sh keyed its result to (branch commit, base commit),
# which every landing on the base invalidates, so under a moving base it restarted from zero
# forever (sp-j4ed). The key here is everything a verdict actually depends on:
#
#   the REPOSITORY         - whose gate it was, named rather than inferred from the rest.
#   the branch's TREE      - what the suites read. Two commits with identical content share
#                            a tree id, so an amend or a clean rebase reuses the verdict.
#   the CHANGED FILE LIST  - what a selective gate chooses its suites from.
#   the GATE COMMAND       - layer 2 in full.
#   THIS HARNESS           - gate.sh, exclude.sh and skew.sh are layer 1; a change to any of
#                            them changes what a pass means, and a cached pass from before it
#                            would be a verdict from a gate that no longer exists.
#
# THE BASE COMMIT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN IT. This gate judges the BRANCH'S TREE, checked out
# detached and on its own, so the base's whole part in the trial is producing the changed-file
# list — and that list is in the key on its own account. Keying on the base commit as well
# would retire a verdict for a reason the trial never read: every landing in the repository
# moves it, so a branch gated twice without being touched — a retry, a second pass, a caller
# that already rebased — would pay in full for the identical trial.
#
# WHAT DOES RETIRE IT IS THE REBASE. A branch brought onto a base that has moved gets the
# base's content in its own tree, so the tree hash moves and the key moves with it. The two
# facts together are the rule: the verdict follows the tree that was judged, and nothing else.
#
# ONLY A PASS IS CACHED, DELIBERATELY. A FAIL is not a pure function of the tree — a flaky
# suite fails once and passes on the next run — and caching one would pin a flake to a branch
# permanently, which is a far worse failure than paying for a re-run. NO_VERDICT is never
# cached because retrying is its entire meaning, and BASE_FAIL is a fact about the base rather
# than about this key. So the cache can only ever save work, never create a wrong answer: the
# worst it can do is skip a gate that would have passed anyway.
#
# IT IS A PURE CACHE and may be deleted at any time.

# THE METER IS DEFINED BEFORE EVERY WAY OUT THAT IT MEASURES, which now means before the
# verdict cache as well as before the lock. A meter only the runs which obtained the tree can
# write is blind to the two readings that matter most: the run that waited its whole budget
# and got nothing, and the run that skipped the tree entirely because the verdict already
# existed. The first version defined it below the cache check, so a reused verdict wrote no
# row at all and was indistinguishable in the log from a gate that was never called — the
# shape every silent-skip bug takes (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).

# Tests run in an explicit, minimal environment. The sentinel service exports

# test-fayth.sh, and two tests asserting the DEFAULT fayth list failed — so correct work was
# rejected because of a deployment setting made an hour earlier, and it would have been
# rejected again on every retry until the bead poisoned. A gate whose verdict depends on
# ambient environment is not deterministic, and a non-deterministic gate is worse than none:
# it rejects good work at random and teaches everyone to ignore it
# (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
#
# What a gate command MAY see is named here and nowhere else: where the branch came from,
# and what it changed. ~/.cargo/bin is on the path because a Rust repository's cheapest
# real gate is `cargo fmt --check` and lib.sh's PATH — written for systemd — has no toolchain
# on it.
#
# SPIRA_GATE_ALL is passed THROUGH rather than set, and defaults to 0. A repository whose gate
# selects its suites from the changed files needs a way to be told to run all of them anyway;
# leaking in from the environment only ever widens what is checked, which is the safe
# direction, and it is named here so that it is a seam rather than an ambient surprise.

# A DEADLINE IS NOT A RED. `timeout` exits 124 when it kills the command, and gate-spira.sh

# and arrived at the landing pass as a bare "this branch failed", with nothing in the bead
# note for the next aeon to act on (sp-p4rl). The budget is the machinery's, not the
# branch's: the full spira gate measured ~1860s against a 900s default (sp-snyj), so the
# common cause of a 124 here is a budget that is too small, which no branch can fix.
# A SILENT RED IS STILL A RED, and this is where the first attempt at this rule was wrong.
# Downgrading every red that printed nothing looks like the fix for sp-p4rl and is not: a
# perfectly ordinary gate command — `test`, a grep, a script that only speaks on success —
# fails silently and legitimately, and treating that as a machinery fault would let a
# genuinely broken branch retry forever and then page the operator about a lock that does not
# exist. sp-p4rl's actual case is the DEADLINE, handled by its own status immediately below.

# What the branch owes the next reader is the command and its status, so a silent red arrives
# as a rejection that can at least be reproduced rather than as an empty note.
