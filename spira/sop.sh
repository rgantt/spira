#
# WHY THIS IS THE SAME MECHANISM AS rule.sh
# -----------------------------------------
# Statutes are how to behave; SOPs are how to fix. They are stored the same way and read
# the same way — `bd remember` / `bd recall`, split by prefix — so Ops reads its runbooks
# exactly as every agent already reads law, rather than through a second knowledge channel
# that has to be invented, delivered and remembered.
#
# WHY AN SOP HAS A SHAPE AND THIS PROGRAM REFUSES PROSE
# -----------------------------------------------------
# A runbook written as a paragraph cannot be matched to an incident by a program and cannot
# be executed without being re-read and re-interpreted. Four fields make it mechanical:
#
#   MATCH:     an extended regex tested against the incident payload   (optional)
#   SYMPTOM:   what you are looking at                                 (required)
#   CHECK:     the command that confirms it is really this             (required)
#   FIX:       what to do about it                                     (required)
#   ESCALATE:  when this is not yours to fix                           (optional)
#   REF:       the long form, usually a wiki page                      (optional)
#
# MATCH is what makes recall deterministic. Matching an incident to a runbook by asking a
# model is the expensive tier; a regex written by whoever resolved the incident is the
# cheap one, and cheap-then-expensive is the whole shape of this harness.
#
# WHY THE WORD CAP
# ----------------
# An SOP is injected into every Ops session, exactly like a statute. 250 words is enough
# for a real procedure and small enough that thirty of them still fit; the long form goes
# behind REF, where it costs nothing until someone needs it.
#
# WHY SPIRA AND NOT THE TOWN
# --------------------------
# Statutes go to both because Gas Town agents still read them. SOPs go only to Spira: the
# Ops persona is the only thing that executes one, it reads the harness database, and putting
# runbooks in the town would charge every polecat context for a book it cannot act on.
#
# WHY AN APPLICATION IS RECORDED, AND WHY THE RECORD IS TWO PLACES
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The loop above told Ops to match a runbook, run its CHECK, then run its FIX — and nothing
# wrote down that any of it happened. A session that matched an SOP and ignored it left
# exactly the trace of one that executed it faithfully, so three questions nobody could
# answer about any SOP on the shelf: how often it fired, how often it was applied, and how
# often the incident came back anyway.
#
# `applied` is that record, and it goes to BOTH a ledger and the bead, because they are read
# by different readers and neither substitutes for the other. The LEDGER is for counting —
# one line, machine-shaped, appended, never rewritten. The BEAD NOTE is for the human reading
# the incident six weeks later, who has the bead in front of them and not this directory.
#
# `--held` IS THE LOAD-BEARING FIELD, and `--held yes` is a FIRST-CLASS OUTCOME. "The SOP fit,
# it held, and it taught us nothing new" is the outcome a healthy shelf produces most of the
# time, and it has to be STATED rather than inferred from silence: the check that fires on a
# session which recorded nothing cannot tell a good quiet session from an absent one, so an
# honest "it worked, nothing to add" is precisely what keeps a good session from being
# punished for it.
#
# THE LEDGER IS APPEND-ONLY AND SORTED BY CONSTRUCTION. One JSON object per line, timestamp
# first, appended in the order the records were made — so the file is in time order without
# anything ever sorting it, and a diff of it only ever grows at the tail. That is the same
# property the sorted-JSONL mirrors have and the same reason: a file that reshuffles puts its
# whole history into every commit and stops being reviewable. It is parseable with `grep` and
# readable with `cat`, which is the situation you are in when the thing that reads it is the
# thing that broke.
#
# LINES ARE SHORT ON PURPOSE. A single `printf` of one line under PIPE_BUF to a file opened
# for append is atomic against other appenders, so two Ops sessions recording at once produce
# two whole lines rather than one interleaved mess. `--why` is therefore truncated in the
# ledger and kept in full on the bead note, which has no such constraint.
#
# THE LAST RECORD FOR A (bead, sop) PAIR WINS. The brief records once between the CHECK and
# the FIX — when `held` is genuinely not known yet — and again once it is. Both lines stay,
# because the first is the evidence the CHECK ran at all and deleting it would be the exact
# erasure this exists to stop; a reader asking "did it hold" takes the last one.
#
# A REFUSAL HERE COSTS MORE THAN A THIN RECORD, so this validates the things that are typos
# and nothing else. An unknown slug, an unspellable verdict, or `--check fail --held yes` —
# a CHECK that did not confirm cannot have held — are refused, because each is a mistake at
# the keyboard that would otherwise poison the count. A missing `--why` is not refused: the
# sibling check fires on the ABSENCE of a record, so a fence that turns a session away here
# would manufacture the very silence it punishes.
#
# WHEN THE SHELF CANNOT BE READ, THE RECORD IS STILL WRITTEN, marked `shelf=unreadable`. The
# slug check exists to catch a typo; if the database is down, refusing would mean the one
# incident where the harness itself is broken is the one incident that leaves no trace.

    # THE READ SIDE, and the reason it lives here rather than in each of its callers: the
    # ledger's format is this program's business, and three consumers writing three parsers
    # is three ways to disagree about what a record means.
    #
    # THE EXIT STATUS IS THE POINT, and it has three values because absence and blindness are
    # different answers that a two-valued status would merge — the merged one reading as
    # all-clear (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
    #
    #   0   at least one matching record; the lines are on stdout
    #   1   the ledger was READ and holds no matching record. A true absence.
    #   2   the ledger could not be read at all. NOT an absence; do not treat it as one.
    #
    # THE FILTERS ARE HERE AND NOT IN THE CALLERS, for the reason above. `--check` and
    # `--since` exist because the closing-rule check in aeon.sh asks a narrower question than
    # "has anything ever been recorded against this bead": it asks whether THIS SESSION
    # recorded that a runbook actually fit. A caller grepping the lines for `"check":"pass"`
    # would be a second parser of this format, and it would also lose the three-valued exit —
    # which is the only thing that separates "no such record" from "cannot read the ledger".

    # from a RETIREMENT, and those are opposite facts: writing a runbook discharges the
