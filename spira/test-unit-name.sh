#
# WHAT THIS SUITE COVERS
# ----------------------
# sp-smbq0 (2026-09-09): strand.sh and doctor.sh addressed units by their
# un-suffixed plain names (spira-sentinel.timer, spira-loom.service) while the
# running units on a post-migration box carry the instance suffix
# (spira-sentinel-prod.timer, spira-loom-prod.service). This caused strand.sh to
# report "sentinel timer: inactive" while the sentinel was firing every two minutes,
# and doctor.sh to print a remediation naming a unit that does not exist.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES of spira_unit, all three of which are necessary for correctness:
#
#   A: instance-qualified form returned when that unit is active (post-migration box)
#   B: plain form returned when only the plain unit is active (pre-migration fallback)
#   C: '?' returned when neither form is known to systemd (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control)
#
# ADDITIONALLY: callers that receive '?' must render 'unknown', not 'inactive'.
#   strand.sh harness_state is tested here; it is the direct source of the three
#   stranded-queue reports that prompted this fix.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control): before asserting that an
# absent unit returns '?', assert that a present unit returns a real name, so a stub
# that always returns '?' would fail the first set of tests and not silently pass all.
#
# systemctl IS STUBBED throughout.  Assertions on what spira_unit returns, and on what
# strand.sh prints, not on systemctl exit codes.
#

# covers: spira/conf.sh spira/strand.sh spira/doctor.sh spira/cockpit.sh spira/auron.sh cockpit/layout.sh
