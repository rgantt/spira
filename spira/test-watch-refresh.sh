# test-watch-refresh.sh — the staleness guard, and the cost of one pass.
#
#   ./test-watch-refresh.sh
#
# WHAT IT HOLDS. The guard exists because a watcher's silence and its blindness look the
# same from outside, so every property here is a way for the guard itself to be quietly
# useless:
#
#   1. A STALE WATCHER IS RESTARTED — and the check that says so is only believable because
#      the same fixture with nothing touched restarts nothing. The positive control runs
#      first (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#   2. AN UNCHANGED WATCHER IS NEVER RESTARTED. This is the half that regresses silently: a
#      guard that restarts everything every minute passes the first property perfectly and
#      is a restart loop on a box running production.
#   3. A PASS COSTS TWO EXECS AND OPENS NO DATABASE. Asserted, not asserted about: the pass
#      runs with a PATH holding nothing but recording shims, so every external program it
#      reaches for is named, and anything unshimmed would fail rather than pass unseen.
#   4. IT FAILS LOUDLY OR NOT AT ALL. A malformed manifest, a `systemctl` that will not
#      answer, a start time in a format it cannot read — each restarts nothing and says so,
#      because a quiet pass is what a broken checker and a healthy fleet have in common.
#
# It needs no database and no beads server, and it never touches the box's own units: the
# only `systemctl` it can reach is a stub that records what it was asked to do.
#
# The units are named explicitly rather than by `systemd/*`: this suite asserts the CPUQuota
# and the 60s cadence out of those two files, so a change to either must run it, while a
# change to some other unit has no business selecting it.
