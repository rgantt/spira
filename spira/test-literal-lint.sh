# test-literal-lint.sh — the fence that refuses configured-name literals outside declaration files.
#
#   ./test-literal-lint.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# literal-lint.sh refuses source files that contain a label, status or type name as a
# literal — names that are declared in schema.sh and read everywhere else through
# SPIRA_*_LABEL env vars set by conf.sh. A literal that bypasses these can disagree with
# the declaration when an operator changes the default: lib.sh:117 once grepped
# "needs-ryan" while lib.sh:221 read "${SPIRA_ASK_LABEL:-needs-ryan}", and the code
# default was needs-operator — so the destructive-procedure fence refused every legitimate
# halting bead on a default install.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE FIRST ASSERTION. A fence that reports a clean tree is
# indistinguishable from one whose matcher never fires, an empty glob, or a bad path —
# and the reassuring reading is what all three give. A literal is planted in a scratch
# repository, the fence is required to name its file and line, the plant is withdrawn,
# and only then is the shipped tree's silence evidence of anything
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# BOTH MODES: --scan (one file) and the whole-tree walk (scratch git repo). They fail
# differently: --scan shows the matcher fires; the walk shows the root is resolved and
# files are actually traversed.
