# test-gate-verdict.sh — the gate computes a verdict once, and reuses it only for the same
# question.
#
#   ./test-gate-verdict.sh
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS AT ALL. Every bead paid the gate at least twice — an aeon runs it
# before it closes, and the landing pass runs it again on the same tree minutes later — and
# that second run was the whole of the close-to-landed latency and most of the contention on
# the gate's single worktree. The verdict cache removes it. What a cache can do wrong is
# answer a question it was never asked, and here that means landing a branch on a trial
# nobody ran: the most expensive failure this harness has, and a silent one, because a reused
# verdict and a real pass are the same exit status.
#
# SO EVERY CASE IS TWO-SIDED. A suite that only checked "the second run was fast" would pass
# just as well against a gate that had quietly stopped running anything
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control), so each case here first proves the repository's own
# gate command CAN run and then requires it to have run, or not to have, by counting its
# invocations. The command is also armed to FAIL while the cache is expected to hold, which
# is the strong form: a run that reached the command at all is a red, not a slower green.
#
# The repository, its remote and its branches are real git, and the gate under test is a copy
# of this harness rather than the installed one — the harness's own bytes are part of the
# key, so a case about a changed harness has to be able to change one.
