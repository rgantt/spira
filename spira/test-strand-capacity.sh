# test-strand-capacity.sh — strand.sh suppresses 'starved' while the account is out of
#   capacity, and every escalation it files carries a --moot-when predicate.
#
#   ./test-strand-capacity.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-9rscu: strand.sh classified a capacity pause (sentinel correctly
# declining to summon) as 'starved' and filed a needs-ryan escalation recommending that
# the operator check the sentinel timer — which was healthy. The condition clears on its
# own when the account reopens; it must not reach Ryan's queue at all. Additionally,
# every escalation strand.sh files lacked --moot-when, so even the correct escalations
# sat in the queue after their condition cleared, requiring manual dismissal.
#
# FOUR CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   0. POSITIVE CONTROL — CAPACITY_PAUSED=0, ready beads, no live aeon → classifier
#      DOES produce "starved". Proves the check can fire before we trust its silence.
#
#   1. CAPACITY PAUSED — CAPACITY_PAUSED=1, same fixture → no "starved" in output;
#      "capacity-paused" IS emitted as an info row.
#
#   2. DETAIL CHECK — the capacity-paused row carries the CAPACITY_DETAIL text,
#      taken from the injected env var rather than re-derived from the log.
#
#   3. MOOT-WHEN CHECK — strand.sh check with a starved --from fixture and no
#      capacity pause → ask.sh is called with a --moot-when argument, so moot-sweep.sh
#      can withdraw the escalation without Ryan once the strand clears.
#
