#
# WHY A SNAPSHOT FILE AND NOT DIRECT CALLS
# ----------------------------------------
# The pane repaints every two seconds. A pane that shelled out to `bd` and `git` would
# freeze on every repaint and paint stale frames while it did — the reason the town
# collector exists, arriving here for the same reason. The cost is paid once per pass; the
# pane reads a file.
#
# Flat `KEY='value'` so a renderer can `source` it with no parser. EVERY VALUE IS
# SHELL-QUOTED: the town snapshot once carried an unquoted `SCHED_CAP=direct dispatch
# (scheduler.max_polecats=-1)`, which is a syntax error that aborts the source, so every
# key after it silently read as unset and the whole panel rendered "?" while the collector
# looked healthy. Writes are atomic, so a half-written file cannot wedge a pane.
#
# SEPARATE FROM .runtime/cockpit.env, DELIBERATELY. That file is Gas Town's and is deleted
# with it; this one is Spira's and must survive that.
#
# THE RULE THAT GOVERNS EVERY PROBE: a probe that fails renders `?`, never 0. The town
# collector's first version returned 0 from its exception handler, so a broken parser
# displayed as "no parked beads" — a panel that reports a broken check as all-clear
# displaces the suspicion that would have prompted a look.

# SP_DUP_BEADS: total surplus beads — sum of (count - 1) per duplicated ref.
# SP_DUP_ROW0..N: the worst offenders, for the watchtower's incident body.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (law-dedup-must-be-measured). Every filer trusts incident.sh's dedup; this
# is the check on the dedup itself. A nonzero SP_DUP_REFS means two or more beads exist for
# the same event, which is the looping-incident pattern that produced 38 surplus beads over
# two days and was found by the operator looking, not by any instrument. When dedup is working
# the meter reads 0; when it breaks the meter says so before anyone has to notice the queue
# filling up.
#
# A FAILED PROBE RENDERS ?, NEVER 0. A dedup meter showing 0 because it could not query is the
# exact failure it exists to catch (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The ? convention
# tells Ops to read the code rather than trust the reassuring zero.

# The two rate-limit windows, read from the newest rate_limit_event across live aeon traces.
#
# WHY TRACES AND NOT THE HOOK. ctx-meter.sh maintains limits.samples from the status-line
# hook, which fires only when the operator's interactive session is speaking. Aeons run
# throughout the day and their traces record rate_limit_event on every API call — so even
# with nobody at the keyboard, the most recent utilisation reading is in whatever trace was
# written last. That reading is what says "the account is approaching full while the operator
# is offline." On 2026-09-06 the five-hour window hit 1.0 three times with nothing on the
# dashboard to warn of it.
#
# THE READING IS FROM THE LAST ~128KB OF THE NEWEST LOG. rate_limit_events fire on every
# API call and are dense in any active session, so the tail reliably holds a recent one
# without reading the whole file. At 30 files maximum, with most already in the VFS cache,
# this costs one seek-and-read per file.
#
# THE SLOPE IS FROM THE HISTORY CSV, not from consecutive trace events. A slope from two
# adjacent events is the per-turn rate on those two turns — dominated by quantisation noise.
# The collector's history at its 60s interval is already smoothed, and a slope from an hour
# of that history is the signal that says "the account will be full in N minutes".
#
# A MISSING OR UNREADABLE TRACE RENDERS `?`, NEVER 0. A window shown at 0% is the best
# possible news; a failed probe must never produce it (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
