# testdb.sh — a REAL `bd` on a throwaway Dolt database. Sourced by a suite,

#
# WHY NOT A STUB. `.claude/spira/testbin/bd` modelled 16 of bd's 118 subcommands, and its
# fidelity was wrong twice in one day in ways that made CALLERS look broken: `list` ignored
# --label entirely, so the CI sweep ran against every fixture bead and the suite failed on
# code that was correct; and a dead duplicate `ready` handler meant two implementations of
# one query disagreed. A partial model of a dependency drifts silently, and every hour spent
# restoring its fidelity reimplements something that already exists and is correct by
# definition (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
#
# TWO MODES. The embedded mode is preferred: each fixture is a private tmpdir directory,
# cleanup is rm -rf, and six concurrent builds complete in ~25s with 0 failures. Server
# mode is the fallback for boxes where bd-embedded is not available; it uses
# dolt-beads-test.service on SPIRA_TESTDB_PORT, which testdb.sh starts on demand.
#
# WHY EMBEDDED IS PREFERRED OVER SERVER. testdb_up against a shared Dolt server cost 84s
# solo and 610s for six concurrent builds (5 of 6 failing), because schema migrations hold
# a global lock and leaked fixtures from SIGKILL'd suites compounded through an age-based
# sweep that ran concurrently against the same server. With the embedded engine each fixture
# is a directory, cleanup is rm -rf, and the problems disappear. The route through
# --proxied-server was also tested and rejected: 'bd import' fails in that mode, and import
# is how fixture-using suites seed their data.
#
# Server mode is the fallback, not the primary path. On any box where bd-embedded is
# available, this file never touches dolt-beads-test.service.
#
# REQUIRES bd-embedded FOR EMBEDDED MODE. The standard binary is built CGO_ENABLED=0 and
# refuses embedded mode. Install: npm install -g @beads/bd (or the project's install.sh).
# The old binary is at ~/.local/bin/bd.cgo0-backup for rollback.
