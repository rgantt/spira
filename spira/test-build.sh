# test-build.sh — build.sh produces both Rust binaries with a stubbed cargo.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL FIRST. Before asserting correct behaviour, the test verifies that
# build.sh exists and is executable — so a tree without it produces a failure rather
# than vacuous success. That is the form of "fail-first" for a new script: the test that
# would catch its absence comes before any test of what it does.
#
# WHAT IS TESTED
# 1. POSITIVE CONTROL: build.sh is present and executable.
# 2. Absent cargo: build.sh exits 0 and names the feature lost; the harness loop continues.
# 3. Ordering: loom is built before the panel; verified from build.sh's own output messages.
# 4. Binaries exist at the paths doctor.sh checks after a normal run.
# 5. Idempotence: a second run completes without error.
# 6. --skip-build exits 0 without invoking cargo.
#
# A real cargo is never called. A stub on PATH creates the expected output files. Ordering
# is read from build.sh's own "building loom" / "building panel" lines.
