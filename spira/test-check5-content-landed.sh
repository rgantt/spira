#
# test-check5-content-landed.sh — Sending followed by CHECK 5 recognises content-landed state.
#
# WHAT THIS TESTS. When a bead's diff is already on the base branch:
#   1. The Sending applies the `content-landed` label and reaps the branch.
#   2. Sentinel CHECK 5 does NOT subsequently reopen the bead.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CATCHES. Two passes used different definitions of "landed": the Sending
# used content_landed (does merging this branch change the base tree?), while CHECK 5
# searched for a commit on the base naming the bead id. A content reap produces no merge
# commit, so CHECK 5 reopened beads the Sending had just correctly reaped — the bead was
# re-worked from scratch, reaped again, and reopened again in a tight loop.
#
# The fix: the Sending labels content-reaped beads `content-landed`; CHECK 5 reads it and
# exempts those beads. This suite proves BOTH halves: the label is applied, the label is
# respected.
#
# THREE CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — a closed bead with no commit IS reopened by CHECK 5 (it is live).
#   2. CONTENT-LANDED — a bead labeled content-landed by the Sending is NOT reopened.
#   3. NORMAL LANDED — a closed bead whose commit IS on the base is also NOT reopened,
#      to confirm the content-landed path does not break the ordinary landing path.
