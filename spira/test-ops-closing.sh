# test-ops-closing.sh — an incident closed with no runbook behind it has its close undone.
#
#   ./test-ops-closing.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES. The Ops brief has called the closing rule — *an incident
# resolved without an SOP must produce one* — "not optional" since the day it was written,
# and it was disobeyed six times in a single day. An instruction that nothing checks is a
# custom; the whole ladder here says the deliverable is a mechanism, so this is the check
# that makes silence cost something.
#
# WHAT "SILENCE" MEANS, EXACTLY, and why the distinction is the entire suite. A session may
# end three honest ways, and each is one command:
#
#   nothing on the shelf fit; something new was diagnosed   sop.sh write
#   an SOP fit but was incomplete                           sop.sh write   (the upsert)
#   an SOP fit and its CHECK confirmed                      sop.sh applied --check pass
#
# The third row is what keeps this from firing on the good case. "It matched, it held, it
# taught us nothing new" is the outcome a healthy shelf produces most of the time and is
# creditable; a check that poisoned it would punish the sessions the design wants. So every
# case here is a PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control): a silent session is required to
# poison, and each honest ending is required NOT to — including the two that are merely
# cheap. A check that never fires and a check that always fires look the same from a report
# that only ever contains one of them.
#
# THE FOUR EDGES WORTH NAMING, because each is a way the rule could go wrong in the direction
# nobody would notice:
#
#   --held no       satisfies. It is an honest outcome of a runbook that genuinely fitted,
#                   and demanding an amendment on top of it would make `--held yes` the
#                   cheapest exit — a lie, in the one field the shelf is measured by.
#   --check fail    does NOT satisfy. That is the session's own statement that nothing on the
#                   shelf applied, which is row one, and row one's exit is a write.
#   a retirement    does NOT satisfy. Removing a runbook is curation; it is not the thing the
#                   incident was supposed to leave behind.
#   an OLD record   does not satisfy a LATER session. The question is what this session
#                   recorded, not whether the bead has ever been recorded against.
#
# AND IT DECLINES TO JUDGE WHAT IT CANNOT READ. An unreadable ledger is not an absence, and
# treating one as an absence would poison every incident closed on the day the database is
# down — the day a runbook is worth most.
#
# THE PERSONA IS A FIXTURE NAMED SOMETHING ELSE, on purpose. The rule is declared by a fayth
# (FAYTH_SOP_REQUIRED) rather than keyed on the string "ops" in aeon.sh, so the suite pins a
# non-default: a healer that is not called ops is still held to the rule, and a builder is
# not. Asserting through the shipped ops.fayth would pass just as well against a check with
# the persona's name written into it.
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh and the REAL sop.sh against a real bd on a throwaway
# fixture, with a shim standing in for the model. What is under test is a comparison of two
# database reads either side of a session, and a stub of either side would be a second
# implementation of the thing in question (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
