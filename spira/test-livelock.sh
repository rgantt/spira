#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# A bead can be open and unreachable for many structural reasons. Before this sweeper, each
# was found by hand, once, after it had already cost hours. The sweeper names each bead and
# why, so a broken graph is seen on the next cockpit pass rather than after someone notices.
#
# CATEGORIES TESTED
#
#   unclaimable          fayth:ops on spira,plan labels — builder excluded by preference,
#                        ops excluded by its own partition. Fifteen-hour strand, 2026-09-09.
#
#   needs-ryan-no-overseer  needs-ryan without overseer: invisible to the decisions pane
#                        and excluded from every fayth predicate.
#
#   unmapped-repo        repo:bogus not in the repo-map; aeon.sh refuses at claim time.
#
#   ci-stuck             awaiting-ci on a push-mode repo; no run will ever report.
#
#   INVALID-CLOSED       closed bead whose close reason contains a statute phrase
#                        ("PERMANENT FIX NEEDED", "temporary", "mitigated-only", "TODO");
#                        law-no-close-reason-admits-unfinished forbids this prospectively,
#                        nothing detected the ones already in the store.
#
#   UNFILED-FOLLOW       closed bead whose close reason implies follow-on work exists
#                        (contains a phrase like "builders should", "the real fix",
#                        "follow-up", "upstream", "at scale") but names no bead id.
#                        A reason that cites a bead id has handed off correctly; one that
#                        does not has left work unfiled. "workaround" is NOT a flag — a
#                        workaround can be complete and landed; the word does not
#                        discriminate whether the work is done.
#
# EVERY CASE IS A PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The negative half proves
# the check can read a true zero; the positive half proves it reads the real fault.
