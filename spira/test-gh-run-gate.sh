# test-gh-run-gate.sh — gh:run gates replace the awaiting-ci label sweep.
#
#   ./test-gh-run-gate.sh
#
# THE MECHANISM THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. `awaiting-ci` was a label that told readers "this
# bead is parked on a CI run". Labels are an unvalidated bag — every reader had to remember
# to exclude the label, and a wrong value returned a truthful empty result at read time
# rather than a refusal at write time. A gate makes the bead NOT READY; a reader that knows
# nothing about CI is still correct.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES this suite verifies:
#
# 1. GATE BLOCKS AND UNBLOCKS. A bead with an open gh:run gate is absent from bd ready.
#    After the gate resolves it is present. The positive control — bead in ready BEFORE
#    the gate is created — is the first assertion so a gate that blocks everything and a
#    gate that blocks nothing are both distinguishable here.
#
# 2. bd gate check uses metadata.repo. When a gate carries metadata.repo=org/repo,
#    bd gate check calls `gh run view <id> --repo org/repo`. Two gates, same await_id,
#    different metadata.repo values; a fake gh that succeeds for one and fails for the
#    other: only the matching gate resolves. This is the cross-repo isolation guard.
#    A gate cannot be resolved by a run from another repository.
#
# 3. bd gate discover runs per-repository. The gate-check script iterates pr-mode repos
#    and calls bd gate discover from within each one's directory. A gate whose branch
#    does not exist in the wrong repo is not matched.
#
# WHY EVERY CASE IS A PAIR. Each mechanism fails by doing nothing. A gate check that blocks
# all calls to gh would prevent resolution; one that accepts any call regardless of repo
# would resolve the wrong gates. The same bead is driven both ways so neither failure mode
# passes silently (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# A REAL bd BECAUSE WHAT IS ASSERTED IS DATABASE STATE — whether a bead is ready, whether
# a gate is open or closed. A stub would be a second implementation of the thing in question
# (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).

# of the real gh intercepts every call without modifying bd or gh. The shim records its
# calls so we can verify metadata.repo became the --repo flag.
