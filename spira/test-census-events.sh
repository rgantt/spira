#
# WHAT THIS SUITE GUARDS
# ----------------------
# Before sp-2lk, bump_requeue/bump_reclaim/bump_recur were no-ops and census.sh
# read labels that nothing wrote. Every pass reported all-clear regardless of how
# many times beads were requeued or recurred. This suite asserts the wire-up works
# end-to-end: bump_requeue/bump_recur/bump_reclaim write events, and census.sh
# aggregates those events into the correct class counts.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control, law-a-regression-test-must-be-seen-to-fail)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The suite was run against the unfixed tree before this commit; it produced
# FAIL for both of the event-based assertions below (census output was empty
# because bump_* wrote nothing and census read labels). The unfixed failure
# text: "wanted [sp-requeue-merge-conflict] in []" and
# "wanted [sp-recur-suite-red] in []".
#
# THREE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
# 1. bump_requeue and bump_recur write events that census.sh counts.
# 2. The class name and occurrence count match the acceptance criteria from sp-2lk.
# 3. bump_reclaim writes events that census.sh counts as sp-reclaim.
#
# A REAL bd ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
