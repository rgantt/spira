#
# maechen-trigger.sh — evaluate the two Maechen trigger conditions and file a sweep
# bead when either fires, with idempotent deduplication.
#
# Two conditions, one watermark. Both are measured from the same watermark so two
# triggers that fire within seconds of each other produce one bead, not two.
#
#   LANDING TRIGGER: counts commits on every managed repo's base branch whose subject
#     names a bead id, since the watermark timestamp. Fires when the count reaches
#     SPIRA_MAECHEN_LANDING_INTERVAL. A landing is a commit whose SUBJECT names a bead
#     id (law-landed-is-content). Bead status is never consulted.
#
#   TIME TRIGGER: fires when more than SPIRA_MAECHEN_MAX_GAP_SECONDS have elapsed since
#     the watermark, even if the landing volume threshold has not been reached.
#
# DEDUP. At most one open trigger bead at a time. maechen.fayth has
# FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT=1; a second open trigger bead would wait forever behind the
# first, building an ever-growing backlog of no-op passes. This guard enforces one open
# trigger as the correct steady state.
#
# WATERMARK. $SPIRA_RUN/maechen.watermark holds a single integer: the Unix epoch
# timestamp when the last trigger fired. A missing or empty file means epoch 0 (never
# fired), which guarantees the time trigger fires on the very first run. The trigger
# writes the new watermark atomically (write to .new, mv into place) BEFORE filing the
# bead. A crash between the write and the bead leaves the watermark advanced but no
# bead; the next run files the bead immediately because the dedup finds nothing open and
# the conditions are still satisfied, which is the correct recovery path.
#
# LANDING COUNT. Counts commits on the remote-tracking base ref of each managed repo
# whose SUBJECT begins with the bead id prefix (SPIRA_ID_PREFIX, default "sp"). The
# home repo is always counted; additional repos are read from SPIRA_REPO_MAP. A repo
# whose base ref cannot be resolved is skipped with a log line.
#
# EXIT:
#   0  bead filed, or an open trigger already exists (dedup) — either is correct
#   1  error writing watermark or filing the bead
