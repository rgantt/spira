# test-sending-unlanded-guard.sh — sending.sh skips unlanded branches; only landed ones are
#   deleted. The "reclaim path" guard: no unlanded branch reaches spira_destroy_branch via
#   sending.sh.
#
#   ./test-sending-unlanded-guard.sh
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST (sp-nxij / sp-mqsl). Before the content fence was added,
# spira_destroy_branch deleted branches unconditionally once the holder-witness checks
# passed. The Sending was the caller on both the landing path (legitimate) and any
# reclaim path that reached it (not). The fix placed two guards:
#
#   1. SELECTOR IN SENDING.SH (this suite). content_landed gates the for-each-ref loop;
#      a branch whose commits are not on the base gets a KEEP log line and is never
#      handed to send_branch. The fence in spira_destroy_branch never sees it.
#
#   2. FENCE IN SPIRA_DESTROY_BRANCH (test-destroy-branch.sh, test-reclaim-slay-branch-guard.sh).
#      Any caller that reaches the function without the bypass arg and without having
#      landed the work is refused there.
#
# This suite covers guard (1): sending.sh's selector. A future change that removes the
# content_landed predicate from sending.sh would not be caught by the fence tests alone,
# because those tests never invoke sending.sh — they call spira_destroy_branch directly.
#
# TWO BRANCHES, TWO OUTCOMES:
#
#   sp-ul: an UNLANDED branch — a real new file not on origin/main, representing an aeon
#          that committed but whose work never merged. sending.sh must KEEP it; the
#          branch must survive the sending pass.
#
#   sp-la: a LANDED branch — a real new file whose diff was squash-merged to origin/main.
#          content_landed returns true (ancestry alone would refuse the squash case, which
#          is why content_landed exists). sending.sh must SEND it; the branch must be gone.
#
# A POSITIVE CONTROL precedes the absence assertion: the landed branch IS deleted, which
# proves the code path reaches send_branch and spira_destroy_branch. Without it, a
# version of sending.sh that skipped every branch would pass the "unlanded branch still
# exists" check (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# FIXTURE CONFIRMATION: content_landed is verified on both branches before running
# sending.sh, so a mis-built fixture (unlanded branch that content_landed sees as landed)
# is caught before the assertions, not silently reported as a sending.sh failure.
#
# A REAL bd ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE (law-prefer-the-real-dependency): sending.sh reads
# the bead's database status via spira_holder_witnesses; a stub would drift.
#
# defect: sp-mqsl
# covers: spira/sending.sh spira/lib.sh
# hermetic-ok: fixture database and local git repos, no systemd, no network
