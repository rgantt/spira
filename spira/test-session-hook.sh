# own settings file.
#
#   ./test-session-hook.sh
#
# WHAT IT HOLDS. The hook's output is prepended to a context window that has just opened, and
# its registration lives in a file no landing gate can reach. Both fail silently by nature, so
# every property below is one that would otherwise be believed rather than known:
#
#   1. A SUMMARY, NEVER A REPLAY. A three-hundred-event backlog must cost a glance. The
#      assertion is on the line count against the configured budget, because the failure being
#      fixed was a hook offering to replay 283 raw lines into a fresh session.
#   2. IT MARKS NOTHING READ. The hook peeks. If it drained, every line it had no room for
#      would be recorded as delivered and the latch that follows would replay nothing — data
#      loss that grows with the size of the backlog.
#   3. DEGRADED IS LIFTED OUT OF THE TABLE. A watcher that is running and blind is silent in
#      exactly the way a healthy quiet one is, so the word is surfaced in its own section —
#      and the suite plants one before believing that it can be absent
#      (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#   4. THE LATCH COMMAND IS THERE FOR EVERY ROW. A hook cannot attach a Monitor, so the
#      command it prints is the only path back to the events it summarised.
#   5. IT NEVER BREAKS A SESSION START. No stdin, malformed stdin, no manifest, an unreadable
#      one: exit 0 every time, and silence where there is nothing to say.
#   6. THE REGISTRATION IS MANAGED, NOT DESCRIBED. Installing twice leaves one entry,
#      unrelated settings survive, and the entry carries NO matcher — a SessionStart matcher
#      naming a subset of sources is how a hook comes to be missing from `compact` and `fork`.
#
# It needs no database and no beads server. Every configured value is pinned to a NON-DEFAULT,
# so a literal written into the hook cannot pass by coincidence, and nothing here can reach
# the operator's own configuration or their live client settings file.

# asserted rather than described — install writes it once, and a timer repairs it.
