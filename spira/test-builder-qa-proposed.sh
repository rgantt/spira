# test-builder-qa-proposed.sh — builder.fayth must exclude qa-proposed so that
#   a QA proposal cannot be claimed as approved work.
#
#   ./test-builder-qa-proposed.sh
#
# THE DEFECT. qa.md tells the QA aeon to file proposals labelled spira,plan,qa-proposed.
# plan IS builder.fayth's partition predicate, and qa-proposed was not in FAYTH_EXCLUDE_LABELS,
# so a proposal was indistinguishable from approved work the instant it was written. A builder
# claimed one; while working it filed more proposals; those summoned more builders. 247
# qa-proposed beads were filed in eight hours by ten builder aeons. (sp-2mhcs)
#
# THE FIX. Add qa-proposed to FAYTH_EXCLUDE_LABELS in builder.fayth.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CHECKS.
#   1. builder.fayth's FAYTH_EXCLUDE_LABELS contains qa-proposed (the direct field check).
#   2. When fayth_ready asks ready_count for the builder, qa-proposed appears in the
#      exclude argument (the end-to-end predicate check).
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT USE. No bd, no systemd, no network. ready_count is stubbed
# to capture its arguments without touching the database.
#
# covers: spira/chamber/builder.fayth spira/lib.sh
# hermetic-ok: no database, no systemd; ready_count and SPIRA_SUMMON are stubs
