#   hermetic.sh                  scan every spira/test-*.sh; exit 1 naming each file and line

#   hermetic.sh --commands       print the two command lists and exit
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR. A suite must judge the code under test, and nothing else. When it reads
# the state of the machine it happens to be running on, its verdict is a fact about that
# machine: it is green for weeks, then turns red the day the box changes rather than the day
# the code does. That failure is worse than an ordinary red, because the branch it refuses is
# innocent and there is nothing in the output pointing anywhere but at the branch. Both
# failures the previous gate produced on the day it was deleted were this, and both were
# found by a human reading the output rather than by anything mechanical.
#
# The rule is already law (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment). It has been re-violated,
# and re-violation is what promotes a rule from something written down to something that
# refuses — so this is that rule as a program.
#
# WHAT IT LOOKS FOR. Two lists, because the two have different remedies.
#
#   UNROUTABLE — systemctl, systemd-run, journalctl, loginctl, gh, gt, crontab. There is no
#   argument that makes these local; they answer for the machine or for a network account.
#   A suite reaches them through a SEAM: the program under test reads `${SPIRA_SYSTEMCTL:-…}`,
#   `${SPIRA_LAUNCH:-…}` or `${SPIRA_GH:-…}`, and the suite points that at a shim it wrote in
#   its own scratch directory. Naming one of these as a command is therefore always a hit.
#
#   DIRECTABLE — bd, git, dolt. Each is hermetic when pointed somewhere disposable and reads
#   the operator's own state when it is not: `git` with no `-C` takes the working directory,
#   and `bd` with no `-C` resolves a database from it. So these are a hit only when the line
#   names nothing the suite created — see below.
#
# HOW A SCRATCH PATH IS RECOGNISED, without evaluating anything. A variable is scratch if it
# was assigned from `mktemp`, or from a value mentioning a variable already known to be
# scratch; the closure runs to a fixpoint, so `TMP=$(mktemp -d)` makes `REPO="$TMP/repo"`
# scratch and `git -C "$REPO"` clean. `SPIRA_DB` counts as scratch in a suite that calls
# `testdb_up`, which is what puts it on a throwaway database.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SEE. Comment lines and heredoc bodies are skipped — a suite
# plants shims by writing them, and the shim's own text is not this suite's behaviour — and a
# command reached through a variable is invisible by construction. That is the right trade:
# a fence is a polite refusal aimed at the honest mistake, and every violation so far was
# somebody calling the obvious command in the obvious way. It is not a sandbox and cannot be.
#
# ITS ESCAPE, DOCUMENTED HERE BECAUSE A SUITE THAT MUST REACH THE BOX SHOULD SAY SO ALOUD.
# Put `# hermetic-ok: <why>` on the offending line or on the line directly above it, and this
# fence steps aside. It is deliberately a comment rather than a config file: the reason belongs
# beside the call, where the next reader of the failure will be, and a suite claiming the
# exemption is then greppable. Rewriting a call to hide from the matcher is the one response
# that is worse than the violation, because the next reader has neither the call nor the claim.

REFUSED by hermetic.sh — the lines above have one of two problems:

  reaches the box — a command whose verdict depends on this machine. A suite that reads the
  real box is green until the box changes, and then it refuses work that is correct with
  nothing in the output pointing anywhere but at the branch. Route the call through the seam
  the program already has — SPIRA_SYSTEMCTL, SPIRA_LAUNCH, SPIRA_GH, SPIRA_BD — and point
  it at a shim in the suite's own scratch directory, or give the command a path under that
  directory.

  exit status unchecked — a testdb_up call whose return is not inspected. testdb_up unsets
  SPIRA_DB on failure, so a suite that ignores the return dies loudly rather than writing to
  production, but the failure message is cleaner and earlier when the suite checks itself.
  Add `|| exit 1` (or a conditional) so the failure names the suite.

If the suite genuinely must reach the box, say so where the call is:

    # hermetic-ok: <why this one has to>

Do not reword the call to slip past the matcher; that leaves the next reader neither the
call nor the reason.
