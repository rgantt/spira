#
# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. Beads were poisoned without their work having been tried
# once. Three separate defects composed into it, and each has a case below:
#
#   1. `bd unclaim --if-assignee` was passed the FAYTH's name while the claim records the
#      AEON's, so the compare-and-swap could never match and a dying aeon never released its
#      bead.
#   2. The teardown ran under `set -e`, so that failing unclaim ended the shell inside its own
#      EXIT trap — after the counter had been bumped, before anything was logged.
#   3. strand.sh then reclaimed the ghost and bumped the SAME counter again. One death, two of
#      the three attempts, and the third summon poisoned the bead.
#
# The counter is now two counters, which is the property under test throughout: poison must
# measure the work and nothing else. And the charging rule is default-DENY — only an outcome
# that names what the WORK did wrong may charge — because every failure mode that cost the
# most was unenumerated when it fired, so a list of exemptions could not have saved any of
# them.
#
# A REAL bd ON A THROWAWAY DATABASE, because every claim here is a claim about what bd does
# with a label, a lease and a compare-and-swap. A stub would be a second implementation of the
# one thing being asked about (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
