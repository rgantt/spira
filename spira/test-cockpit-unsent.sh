# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. SP_BRANCH_DONE was echoed inside the per-repo loop and
# write_snapshot's first-wins dedup pinned it to the first repository's count, which was always
# zero because brain has no closed-bead branches. And SP_UNSENT counted every ref under
# refs/heads/spira/* regardless of whether the suffix resolved to a bead, so a stray ref was
# a permanent +1 on a figure whose whole purpose is to trend to zero.
#
# BOTH DEFECTS ARE INVISIBLE TO A SINGLE-REPO TEST. The per-repo overwrite only fires when a
# second repository contributes differently from the first, and a non-bead branch only matters
# when the probe distinguishes it from real work. This suite drives a TWO-repo fixture and
# plants both shapes.
