# test-watch-notify.sh — delivery that does not need a reader, and the once-only property
# that is the whole reason it is allowed to exist.
#
#   ./test-watch-notify.sh
#
# WHAT IT HOLDS. `watchd.sh notify` is a timer that escalates events nobody has drained, so
# an answer given while no session was running still reaches somebody. Every failure it can
# have is a way of being worse than nothing:
#
#   1. ONE ESCALATION PER BACKLOG, NEVER ONE PER PASS. The condition persists until somebody
#      acts on it, so a timer that asked again every five minutes would be a false-alarm
#      generator — and a false alarm is a real cost, because the noise is what teaches an
#      operator to scroll past the one that matters (law-alerts-must-be-actionable).
#   2. DRAINING CLEARS IT, AND THE NEXT BACKLOG IS HEARD. Suppression that outlived its
#      condition would swallow the second occurrence entirely, which is the same silence
#      arriving later.
#   3. THE CURSOR IS NOT TOUCHED. Escalating is an extra copy of the event, never a
#      substitute for it: a notify that marked what it reported as read would make the ask
#      the only delivery and would clear the condition it was reporting on.
#   4. IT REFUSES RATHER THAN PASSING when it could not check — a malformed manifest, an
#      unreadable threshold, no filter — because "nothing is waiting" and "I could not look"
#      are the same exit code otherwise (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#   5. A FINDING IS NOT CONSUMED BY A BROKEN CHANNEL. If the escalation path refuses, nothing
#      is stamped, so the retry once it is repaired still carries the event.
#
# It needs no database, no beads server and no systemd: every watcher here is a `log` row,
# which is a file something else writes, and the escalation path is a stub that records what
# it was handed.
#
# In an explicit, minimal environment, with SPIRA_CONF pointed at a file that does not exist
# so the operator's own configuration cannot decide a verdict. SPIRA_ACTIONABLE is pinned to
# a word that appears in no shipped default, and the decoy lines below are written in the
# SHIPPED vocabulary — so a filter expression written into the code instead of read from
# configuration fails here rather than passing by coincidence.
