# test-gate-covers.sh — the landing gate selects non-gated suites by their # covers:
# globs; changed files matched by no suite trigger the whole non-gated set as a fallback.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# gate-spira.sh runs a fixed set of suites (gate-suites) on every branch. This bead adds
# coverage-based selection: non-gated suites whose `# covers:` globs intersect the branch's
# diff are also run, so a change to spira/incident.sh triggers test-incident-dedup.sh at
# the gate rather than waiting for the next timed-run window.
#
# THE TWO-SIDED POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
# A selector that silently never fires looks identical to one that fires and finds nothing.
# Two cases prove both directions:
#
#   A. src/a.sh changes → test-cv-fail.sh (covers src/a.sh, exits 1) is selected and
#      refused at the gate. Without selection, a non-gated suite is never reached.
#
#   B. Same failing suite, but with its covers line removed. src/a.sh is now unmapped
#      (no suite explicitly declares it). The unmapped-runs-everything fallback fires,
#      test-cv-fail.sh runs as part of the whole non-gated set, and the gate still refuses.
#      Absence of an explicit declaration must not read as a pass.
