# when a suite hangs past its per-suite limit.
#
#   ./test-suites-timeout.sh
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS (sp-3cb0). The service timed out at 05:44, 06:44, 07:44 — a suite hung
# and the runner wedged on it. Every hourly pass died mid-run. Two properties must hold to
# prevent the recurrence:
#
#   1. spira-suites.service has TimeoutStartSec — a unit-level kill that ends a pass that
#      has completely stalled. This is the last line of defense.
#
#   2. suites.sh wraps each suite in `timeout $PER_SUITE` — a suite that hangs is killed
#      (rc=124), recorded as `timeout`, filed as a bead, and the runner continues to the
#      suite that follows. A runner that wedges on one hung suite reproduces the defect.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL IS FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Before trusting "the
# next suite ran", prove the hung suite was actually killed: its result file says `timeout`,
# not `ok`. A pass that never killed the suite would produce the same "next suite ran"
# appearance only after the suite finally exited on its own.
#
# THE INTAKE IS THE REAL ONE on a throwaway database (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
# The dedupe and filing are what matter; a stub would reproduce whichever half the author
# remembered.
#
# EVERY CONFIGURED VALUE IS PINNED TO A NON-DEFAULT so a literal in the code cannot pass
# this (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
