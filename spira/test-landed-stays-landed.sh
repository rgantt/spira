# test-landed-stays-landed.sh — end-to-end: a closed bead whose commit is on origin/<base>
#   is never reopened by CHECK 5, across the two failure modes that historically caused it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-d9x93 and sp-796o caused CHECK 5 to reopen 34 beads whose work had
#   genuinely landed on the base branch:
#
#   WINDOW DEFECT (sp-d9x93): CHECK 5 used git log -n 400 (400-commit window). A bead
#   whose commit was commit 401+ from the tip was invisible and reopened as
#   closed-without-landing. sp-a9g hit this at commit 401, sp-37q at commit 400.
#
#   BODY DEFECT (sp-d9x93): CHECK 5 searched --format='%s' (subject line only). A bead id
#   appearing only in the commit body was not found and the bead was reopened. sp-m0s7.
#
#   The fix: sentinel's CHECK 5 now walks the full ancestry with --format='%B'.
#
# THE E2E INVARIANT. This suite asserts the property directly: land a real commit naming a
#   bead on origin/<base>, run the sentinel, bead stays closed. The deep-history case pads
#   401 commits after the landing commit so a windowed search would miss it.
#
# CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — closed bead with no commit IS reopened (CHECK 5 is live)
#   2. DEEP COMMIT — commit 401+ back stays closed (window-free search)
#   3. BODY-ONLY — bead id only in commit body stays closed (full %B search)
#   4. TWO PASSES — stays closed on second pass (no state accumulated between passes)
#
# SEEN TO FAIL AGAINST UNFIXED CODE. Both probe sections below install a patched sentinel
#   with the old window/format and confirm the test WOULD HAVE FAILED:
#     PROBE FAIL deep: bugged sentinel reopens sp-deep (window=1) — wanted [open] got ...
#     PROBE FAIL body: subject-only sentinel reopens sp-body — wanted [open] got ...
#   Both probes were confirmed to fire before this test was committed (sp-wg6hi).
#
# defect: sp-d9x93 sp-796o
# covers: spira/sentinel.sh spira/lib.sh
# hermetic-ok: uses a fixture database and a local git repo, no systemd or gh
