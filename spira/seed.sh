#   seed.sh                 write every statute not already in force
#   seed.sh --dry-run       say what it would write, change nothing

# WHY THIS EXISTS. Statutes live in the beads KV store, which is per-installation. The
# harness ships the mechanism; without this step a fresh install carries none of the law
# that makes it behave, and every rule in statutes/ has to be rediscovered the expensive
# way. Run it once at install, and again after a pull that adds statutes.
#
# IT NEVER OVERWRITES. A key already in the database is skipped and said so, because an
# operator who amended a statute meant it, and a seeder that reverts local law on every
# upgrade is worse than one that never runs.
