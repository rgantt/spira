# review.sh — adversarial code review of a release unit's aggregate diff.
#
#   review.sh <tag>          run the adversarial review (default command)

#   review.sh verdict <tag>  print the stored verdict: ship, block, or none
#
# A release unit is an annotated tag produced by release.sh cut. The reviewer:
#   1. computes the aggregate diff from the previous unit to this one
#   2. calls SPIRA_REVIEWER_MODEL with an adversarial brief
#   3. parses the verdict (SHIP or BLOCK) and each finding
#   4. files each BLOCK-level finding as a bead naming the unit's tag
#   5. writes the verdict and cost to SPIRA_REVIEWER_VERDICTS/<tag>.verdict
#   6. exits 0 (ship) or 1 (block)
#
# IT IS ADVERSARIAL BY BRIEF, not by tone. Its job is to find what the gate
# cannot: intent violations, cross-commit interactions, and irreversible changes
# disguised as routine ones.
#
# VERDICT STORAGE. After a run the verdict is written to a file in
# SPIRA_REVIEWER_VERDICTS (default: $SPIRA_RUN/review-verdicts). promote.sh
# reads this to refuse a blocked unit. The file carries the verdict, cost,
# token counts, finding count and timestamp, so the reviewer's cost per unit
# is readable without re-parsing the trace.
#
# MODEL. SPIRA_REVIEWER_MODEL defaults to claude-fable-5-1. An id the CLI
# rejects does not fail loudly — the process exits non-zero, review.sh
# exits 2, and promote.sh refuses to promote the unreviewed unit. Verify the
# id on this box before deploying (the bead description explains why).
#
# COST. After each run, cost is written to SPIRA_REVIEWER_VERDICTS/<tag>.verdict
# as cost_usd, in_tok, and out_tok so the reviewer's per-unit cost is a
# queryable number, not a text field to parse.
#
# EXIT   0  ship — unit is clean, no blocking findings
#        1  block — blocking findings filed as beads; do not promote this unit
#        2  usage or fatal error (unit NOT reviewed; treat as unreviewed)

This is NOT a style review. Only report DEFECTS of these kinds:
  1. A change whose effect contradicts the stated intent of the beads it contains
     (a bead that says \"detect X\" but the code does Y)
  2. A cross-commit interaction: two changes in this unit that are each safe in
     isolation but together break an invariant

Respond with EXACTLY one of these two formats:

If the unit is clean:
VERDICT: SHIP

If the unit has defects:
VERDICT: BLOCK
FINDING: <one-line title naming the file and the defect>
<specific description: which hunk, what the failure mode is, why a gate cannot catch it>
---
FINDING: <another title>
<description>
---

Rules:
- Only BLOCK if you found a genuine defect of one of the three kinds above.
- If unsure, SHIP — a false block stops a queue; a missed finding produces a
  bead and a fix, which is the intended remediation path.
- Every FINDING must name the specific hunk or file and state the failure mode.
- Do not report style, coverage gaps, or hypothetical issues.'
