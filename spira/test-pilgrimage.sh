# test-pilgrimage.sh — a completed pilgrimage announces itself as an EVENT.
#
#   ./test-pilgrimage.sh
#
# The announcement leg had no suite at all, which is how it spent a day writing the wrong
# kind of bead: `PILGRIMAGE COMPLETE — <id>: <title>` went out as `ask.sh insight`, and two
# of the eleven beads in the insights queue were outcomes wearing an insight's label
# (sp-94h, hq-5enm). An insight is what an agent LEARNED and might become law; an outcome is
# what HAPPENED. They are read by different people for different reasons and they now have
# different bins.
#
# So this is not a test of pilgrimage detection — `bd epic status` already answers that. It
# is a test of what the notice IS, end to end through the real ask.sh onto a real bd, and of
# the two properties that make it safe to emit at all: it is created CLOSED, and it carries
# no labels, so it can never be claimed by an aeon as work.
#
# EVERY CASE HAS ITS NEGATIVE. An epic with an open child must emit NOTHING, and the suite
# proves the check could have seen something by running the positive first — an assertion of
# absence from a probe that was never pointed at anything is indistinguishable from a pass
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
