# WHY THIS EXISTS. Stopping Spira meant remembering six unit names and then hunting aeon
# processes by hand, so in practice nobody stopped it — they stopped ONE timer and left the
# rest running, or killed a runner and left its model session headless. A control that is a
# checklist is a control nobody uses in the moment they need it (2026-09-07: the loop spent
# two days re-summoning aeons onto a bead that could not finish, and halting it took a
# session of archaeology).
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH, deliberately:
#   dolt-beads*.service   the databases. Stopping the world must never risk the data, and a
#                         stopped server makes every diagnostic you are about to run fail.
#   cockpit*, concierge   the panes the operator is reading. Halting the loop must not also
#                         blind the person halting it.
# `stop --hard` adds the watchers; nothing here ever stops Dolt.

# DRAIN IS NOT A SOFTER STOP — IT IS A DIFFERENT SHAPE. `stop` halts the timers, the work
# services and the live aeons, because it exists to make everything quiet. `drain` closes the
# door and lets the room empty: no NEW aeon is summoned, while the loop, landing and reaping
# all keep running so an aeon already working can finish and LAND what it built.
#
# NOTHING IS STOPPED, so there is no SERVICE to forget to restart. THE STAMP IS STILL A THING
# TO FORGET, and it was forgotten: an Ops sweep applying sop-harness-checkout-behind drained
# at 18:02:03 on 2026-09-09, finished its SOP at 18:04:29, and exited without resuming. The
# world stayed gated for 59 minutes with 25 beads ready and zero aeons, and every pass
# reported "pass complete — goal reached" while doing so. The sentinel was behaving correctly
# — a drain is a mode, not a fault — so nothing anywhere treated it as one.
#
# SO THE DRAIN EXPIRES. It carries a deadline and the gate lifts it when that passes, loudly.
# A drain is a held breath: legitimate for the minutes an operation needs, never for an hour,
# and a holder that dies must not take the loop with it. `--for` sets the lifetime; the gate
# in lib.sh enforces it, so every caller is covered by one rule.
#
# NOT THE SAME AS `--timeout`, which bounds how long `drain` WAITS for live aeons to finish
# before returning. That is this command's patience; this is the gate's lifetime after the
# command has gone.
#
# The gate is a stamp file that summon_fayth() checks in lib.sh — one place, covering every
# caller. The first attempt at this stopped spira-sentinel.timer instead, which also stopped
# landing, because landing is a leg of the sentinel pass rather than a timer of its own:
# three finished branches sat unlanded for sixteen minutes (2026-09-08).
