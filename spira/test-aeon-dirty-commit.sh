# test-aeon-dirty-commit.sh — pre-existing dirty files must not appear in an aeon's commit.
#
#   ./test-aeon-dirty-commit.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES. An aeon working in a shared checkout ran `git add -A` and
# staged a file written by another process (the archivist). The commit named the bead but
# carried none of the aeon's own work — only the archivist's uncommitted draft. The guard
# installed by aeon.sh prevents this by refusing to commit any path that was dirty
# (modified or untracked) before the aeon's session began.
#
# THREE CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   1. `git add -A` stages the dirty file → commit is refused and names the offender.
#   2. `git add -- <own-path>` succeeds and the dirty file is absent from the commit.
#   3. SPIRA_ALLOW_DIRTY_STAGE=1 overrides the guard — the fence names its own bypass.
#
# Driven against pre-commit-guard.sh directly, without a full aeon.sh invocation. The hook
# is what enforces the rule; testing via aeon.sh would test that the harness invoked a
# model, not that the guard actually fires.
