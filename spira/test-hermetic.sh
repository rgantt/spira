#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment was law and was re-violated twice in a day, both times
# caught by a human reading a failure rather than by anything mechanical. Re-violation is what
# promotes a rule from prose to a program, and hermetic.sh is that program; this is the proof
# that it can actually refuse.
#
# The failure mode being fenced is nastier than an ordinary red, and it is why the fence has
# to be mechanical. A suite that asks the real systemd whether a unit is running is GREEN for
# as long as the box happens to be in the state its author had — it turns red the day the
# machine changes rather than the day the code does, it then refuses work that is correct,
# and there is nothing in its output pointing anywhere except at the branch. Both failures the
# previous gate produced on the day it was deleted were exactly this.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE FIRST ASSERTION AND EVERYTHING AFTER IT IS READ THROUGH IT
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). A fence that reports the shipped tree clean is
# indistinguishable from a fence whose matcher never fires, from a bad path, or from an empty
# glob — and the reassuring reading is the one all three give. So a bare `systemctl` is
# planted, the fence is required to name its file and its line, the plant is withdrawn, and
# only then is the shipped tree's silence worth anything.
#
# BOTH HALVES ARE EXERCISED, because they fail differently. `--scan` is the matcher and is
# fed one planted shape at a time. The whole-tree walk is the part that finds the suites at
# all, so it is run against a scratch repository built for the purpose rather than only
# against the real one — a walker that resolved the wrong root would pass every assertion a
# `--scan` test could make.
#
# THE PROGRAM RUNS IN AN EMPTY ENVIRONMENT. It is a fence over hermeticity; a suite for it
# that let the box decide its verdict would be the joke it is meant to prevent.
