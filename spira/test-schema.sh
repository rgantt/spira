# THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. A name that resolves to the empty string is worse than one that
# errors: an empty label in a query is a well-formed question about nothing. It returns []
# truthfully, the refusal guard sees output rather than silence, and the pane prints a
# confident 0 — which is sp-xrkuu, where SP_READY read 0 against a true 32 and the first
# hypothesis was staleness, because a wrong answer and a correct one look identical from
# outside.
#
# So the load-bearing assertion here is the NEGATIVE one: an undeclared key must exit
# non-zero and print nothing usable on stdout. The positive cases are the control that proves
# the negative is not passing by accident (law-a-regression-test-must-be-seen-to-fail).
