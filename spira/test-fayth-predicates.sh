# test-fayth-predicates.sh — fayth predicates select on schema-validated fields, not bare
# partition literals.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE VERIFIES
# 1. No active .fayth file contains a bare partition literal in FAYTH_LABELS — asserted by
#    scanning the source, with a positive control that proves the scanner fires before we
#    rely on its silence (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
# 2. Every active persona resolves to a non-empty partition label at runtime (fayth_get
#    actually expands $SPIRA_PLAN_LABEL etc., rather than handing an unexpanded string to bd).
# 3. REGRESSION (sp-xrkuu class): schema_name must fail closed on an undeclared key, not
#    return 0. A reader that asks for a partition it cannot name returned [] from bd, which
#    the refusal guard read as "no work" — printing a confident 0 against a true 32.
#
# The positive control for item 3: plan and incident are declared names, so schema_name
# succeeds on them. If either were absent here, the fayth-level expansion below would still
# resolve (the default is baked into the variable form), but a reader that calls
# schema_name plan would error — catching a misconfiguration rather than silently using the
# wrong label.
#
# defect: sp-xrkuu (partition query returned [] due to unexpanded shell in the label)
# covers: spira/chamber/*.fayth spira/schema.sh spira/conf.sh
