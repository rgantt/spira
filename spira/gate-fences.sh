# gate-fences.sh — derive and copy the fence files gate-spira.sh declares.
#
# Source this into suites that build a gate-spira.sh fixture. The fence list is
# read from the gate at call time, so a fence added to gate-spira.sh requires
# no edit in any suite.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Both copy
# functions fail if the gate declares no fences — an empty list and a bad path
# produce the same silence from outside, and neither may read as success.

#   gate_fence_list  <gate-script>                — print one fence path per line
#   gate_fence_cp    <gate-script> <src> <dst>    — copy real fence files from src into dst
#   gate_fence_stubs <gate-script> <dst>          — write exit-0 stubs into dst

# gate_fence_list <gate-script>
# Print the relative fence paths the gate declares (e.g. spira/literal-lint.sh),
# one per line. Reads the `for fence in ...; do` loop that gate-spira.sh uses as
# its machine-readable fence list.
