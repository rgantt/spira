# schema.sh — the ONE declaration of the bead model, and the only file allowed to contain a
# label, status or type literal.
#
#   schema.sh contract              the model, declared beside what the store actually reports
#   schema.sh check                 exit non-zero when the store has drifted from the declaration
#   schema.sh name <key>            one name, resolved; fails closed on an undeclared key
#   schema.sh kinds|statuses|dims   the declared vocabularies, one per line
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# A name that appears as a literal in a reader is a name that can disagree with the writer.
# spira/lib.sh:221 reads "${SPIRA_ASK_LABEL:-needs-ryan}" while spira/lib.sh:117 greps for a
# hardcoded "needs-ryan" — and the code default is `needs-operator`, so on a default install
# the destructive-procedure fence has NO bypass at all and every legitimate halting bead is
# refused. The same split exists for awaiting-ci (6 files), spike (10), groom (6),
# maechen-sweep (3). One accessor per name makes that class unwritable, because there is no
# literal left to write.
#
# WHAT IS DECLARED HERE vs WHAT IS ASKED
# --------------------------------------
# Declared here: the KINDS, the custom STATUSES, and the state DIMENSIONS. These are our
# model; nothing else in the world knows them, so this file is their source.
#
# Asked, never written down: personas and their partitions (the .fayth files), the repository
# map, and the type/status vocabularies the bd binary will actually accept. `bead.sh contract`
# already works this way and the reason generalises — a list written down is a list that goes
# stale silently, which is how world.sh came to miss nine timers.
#
# `contract` prints DECLARED beside REPORTED precisely so a drift is visible rather than
# inferred, and `check` is the same comparison with an exit code (law-schema-over-code: the
# store enforces what it can; this file covers what SQL cannot express).

# THE DECLARATION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# KIND — what a record IS. It never changes over the record's life, which is why it is a
# type rather than a status. Every work query excludes the non-work kinds BY TYPE, which is
# validated, rather than by a label predicate each reader has to remember.
#
# `insight` is deliberately NOT a type: an insight is created closed, so every work query
# already excludes it on status, and a type would cost something in each reader that
# enumerates types while buying nothing. It is a closed `chore`
# carrying the `insight` label at P4.
#
# `gate` is bd's own type, backing await_type/await_id/timeout/waiters. It is listed here so
# that exhaustive registration does not retire it by omission.
SCHEMA_KINDS="work:task event:event escalation:escalation proposal:proposal insight:chore gate:gate"

# The kinds a work query returns. Anything not here is excluded by type.
SCHEMA_WORK_TYPES="task bug feature epic chore spike"

# STATUS — where a record is UP TO. Mutually exclusive by construction, which is the point:
# a bead cannot be both approved and premise_rejected, and today's label bag permits it.
#
# awaiting_ci is NOT here. It is a gh:run GATE, because a status still requires every reader
# to remember to exclude it while a gate makes the bead not ready — so a reader that knows
# nothing about CI is still correct.
SCHEMA_STATUSES="approved premise_rejected retired archived"

# DIMENSION — a single-valued attribute, written with `bd set-state <id> <dim>=<val>` and read
# with `bd state <id> <dim>`. set-state removes the previous dim: label atomically, so
# single-valuedness is enforced rather than merely observed, and it writes an event bead as
# the source of truth with the label as a lookup cache.
#
# A dimension with no enumerable value set declares `*`.
