# The heartbeat's job is to tell "the model is doing work" from "the process is alive". The
# old signal — log file growth — could not: tool_progress heartbeats write to the log every
# ~30s while the model is blocked, so a fully stuck aeon's log grows steadily. These cases
# cover the signal that replaced it: elapsed_time_seconds on the trailing heartbeat, the
# process subtree check, and the flock exemption.

# No database, no network, under a second.
