#   governor.sh            write the budget, print one line
#   governor.sh --report   the human view: headroom, throughput, what is throttling
#
# WHY A SEPARATE ENTITY (the operator's call)
# -------------------------------------------
# "another entity keeping track of throughput to make sure we're within the resource
# constraints of this machine."
#
# The box this runs on may not be a build farm. It may also be running production services,
# two GitHub Actions runners, the whole of Gas Town, and the operator's own session. An aeon is an
# Opus session plus a cargo build plus a test suite, and nothing in the harness previously
# asked whether the machine could afford one — FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT is a COUNT, which is a
# proxy for load and not a measure of it.
#
# The budget is a deterministic function of what /proc says — averaged over the interval
# since the last pass, and folded into a moving average across passes. The first version
# decided from one two-second sample per pass, and its own history showed budgets of 0, 1
# and 2 within minutes at a constant aeon count: a two-second window lands on or between a
# gate's suites at random. The arithmetic lives in governor-budget.py so a fixture can drive
# it; this file reads /proc and remembers the last counters in budget.env. It never GROWS a
# fayth's own cap; it only withholds, so a fayth's concurrency stays the ceiling and this
# is the floor.
#
# THE ANSWER IS HEADROOM — how many MORE aeons may start. The old formula counted the aeons
# that would fit in the idle CPU, which is additional aeons since the running ones are
# already in the load, and lib.sh then read it as a total and subtracted the running count
# again: the more aeons ran, the more it withheld. SP_HEADROOM is what fayth_free clamps by;
# SP_BUDGET is running + headroom, a total, for readers that want one.
#
# IT MUST FAIL CLOSED-ISH, NOT OPEN. An unreadable probe yields the fayth's configured cap
# rather than infinity, and says so — but a probe that reads FINE and reports pressure
# must actually throttle. A governor that cannot be seen throttling has never been tested.

# aeons, measured CPU idle said 2 at 65% idle — and a throttle built on a number nobody
# trusts yet is a throttle that will be wrong in a direction nobody notices. In `measure`
# the budget is computed, recorded and logged, and clamps nothing. Flip to `enforce` when
