#   ./test-gate-tree.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS. Two gates for the same repository ran concurrently. While one
# was running suites, the other checked a different branch out over the same directory;
# git -C <tree> log --oneline -1 reported the OTHER run's branch. Both runs were inside
# their trial at the time, so each was running suites from a tree it did not put there.
# A gate that passes work it never looked at is the worst failure a gate has, and a gate
# that fails a branch on someone else's code poisons it without cause.
#
# test-soak.sh exercises the property under multi-aeon contention. This suite tests the
# mechanism directly: the flock, the meter and the timeout, each as a separate case so a
# break names itself. The soak takes ~90s; this takes ~10s.
