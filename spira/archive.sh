# archive.sh — keep every session transcript, indexed by time range and by lineage.

#   archive.sh sweep [--force] [path ...]
#                                    archive what has changed and rewrite the index
#   archive.sh hook                  a session-end hook payload on stdin; archive that one
#   archive.sh query [filters]       index rows matching a time window, a lineage, a slug
#   archive.sh lineage <session-id>  every transcript in that session's chain, oldest first
#   archive.sh restore <id|path>     the original bytes, on stdout, hash-checked
#   archive.sh verify [id|path ...]  re-hash archived bodies against the index
#   archive.sh where                 the archive root and what is in it
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The client writes each session to a transcript under its own directory,
# outside every repository, unversioned, on whatever volume the home directory sits on, with
# no retention promise to anyone. That file is the only record of every decision taken in
# conversation that never became a bead — which is precisely the material nothing else here
# keeps. This copies it somewhere durable and writes an index that can be queried, so a
# later "what did we decide that afternoon" is a command rather than an archaeology project.
#
# THE LINEAGE, AND WHY IT IS THE INDEX'S REASON FOR EXISTING. Clearing the context starts a
# NEW transcript with a new session id, so "the current session log" is only ever the tail of
# the conversation. The client records a stable `bridgeSessionId` in the first few lines of
# every file in a lineage, unchanged across those clears — so one field turns a chain of
# files into one queryable conversation. Index it and a lineage is a command; miss it and
# every consumer downstream re-implements the same guess, differently.
#
# THE BODIES NEVER GO IN A SHARED REPOSITORY. A transcript carries paths, credentials read
# aloud, and everything anyone ever said in it. The archive lives outside every checkout by
# default, and the runtime directory it defaults into is gitignored for the same reason a
# beads database is (law-beads-is-never-public). If something derived is ever wanted in git,
# it is the INDEX — metadata, no message content — and even then only where a reader can see
# it is derived.
#
# RETENTION IS A DECISION, NOT A DEFAULT. Nothing here deletes anything, ever. When the
# volume eventually says otherwise that is the operator's call, and the index is what makes
# it answerable rather than a guess: bytes per lineage, per month, per project directory.
