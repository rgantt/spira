# watch-refresh.sh — restart a watcher whose code is newer than the process running it.
#
#   watch-refresh.sh            one pass; restart what is stale and say so
#   watch-refresh.sh --dry-run  say what it would restart and change nothing
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. A long-lived process pins the configuration it read at
# startup, and nothing about it looks wrong afterwards: a watcher started before a database
# cutover went on addressing the retired databases for days, its state holding not one id
# from the live store, while every process listing showed it healthy and every pass it ran
# was silent. A watcher's silence and its blindness are indistinguishable from outside
# (law-long-lived-processes-pin-their-config), so the repair cannot wait for someone to
# notice — it has to be mechanical, and it has to be on a timer.
#
# This is `cockpit-ensure` for daemons rather than for panes, and the two stay separate
# because a pane and a daemon fail for different reasons.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS "THE CODE" OF A WATCHER. Not simply the unit's ExecStart, because every
# watcher unit's ExecStart is the DISPATCHER — `watchd.sh exec <name>` — and the program a
# watcher actually runs is the row's target. So a pass compares the unit's start against the
# newest of:
#
#   the unit's own ExecStart program        a stale install pointing at another harness copy
#   the row's target program                the watcher itself
#   the shell and python files BESIDE it    the libraries it sources; the measured failure
#                                           was a rewritten library, not a rewritten target
#   watchd.sh                               the dispatcher that resolves the row
#   the manifest                            what the row says the target IS
#   conf.sh and the config file in force    every path and label the watcher reads
#
# The sibling sweep is deliberately restricted to `*.sh` and `*.py`. A watcher's directory
# also holds state it writes while running, and a check that stat'ed all of it would restart
# the watcher on its own output, every pass, forever. Code files are not written at runtime.
#
# MTIME, NOT A CONTENT HASH. A checkout that rewrites mtime without changing content costs
# one harmless restart, and that is the cheaper mistake. The meter that says when this stops
# being adequate is the per-watcher restart counter `watchd.sh` keeps — rendered as the
# RESTARTS column of `watchd.sh status` — and a number climbing without an edit behind it is
# the evidence that would justify hashing (law-take-the-simple-fix-with-a-meter). Which is
# why the restart below is issued through `cmd_restart` and not through `systemctl`: that
# command is where a restart is counted, so a restart around it is one the meter never sees.
#
# IT MUST BE CHEAP. It runs every minute on a box that may be running production on very few
# cores, and an unbounded loop here is the thing the fencing law is named for. So a steady
# pass costs exactly TWO execs — one `systemctl show` for every unit at once, one `stat` for
# every path at once — and runs no other program at all. It never opens the database: a
# staleness check that queried the store would be the very failure it exists to detect.
# Everything else is done in-process, which is why the manifest is parsed by sourcing
# `watchd.sh` rather than by running it.
#
# A PASS THAT CANNOT SEE FAILS LOUDLY AND RESTARTS NOTHING. A malformed manifest, or a
# `systemctl` that will not answer, exits non-zero with the reason — never a quiet pass,
# which is what a broken checker and a healthy fleet have in common
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
