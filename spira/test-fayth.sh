# test-fayth.sh — summon_fayth uses each fayth's own predicate, not a shared one;
#   spira_fayths discovers every fayth in the chamber rather than returning a hardcoded name.
#
#   ./test-fayth.sh
#
# THE DEFECT. sentinel.sh CHECK 7 computed a single $ready from --label spira,plan — the
# builder's partition — and gated every persona's summon on it. Ops was therefore
# unreachable by construction: an incident arriving while no plan work was queued summoned
# nothing, and ops only ever woke when the BUILDER had work, which is exactly backwards for
# an on-call role. ops.fayth shipped complete and inert on 2026-09-05, with a correct
# predicate that nothing ever evaluated.
#
# THE FIX. summon_fayth calls fayth_ready, which sources the fayth file and asks ready_count
# through THAT fayth's FAYTH_LABELS — so each persona's readiness is its own question.
# spira_fayths enumerates chamber/*.fayth rather than returning a literal name, so adding a
# fayth file is the whole installation step.
#
# WHY summon_fayth IS IN lib.sh. Everything else in a sentinel pass touches the real
# repository and the real database; moving summon_fayth here is what makes it exercisable
# by this suite without either.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT USE. No bd, no systemd, no network. ready_count is overridden
# with a stub (after sourcing lib.sh, so the subshell in fayth_ready inherits the
# override). The observed label is written to a file because a subshell variable assignment
# cannot reach the parent.
#
# defect: sp-fayth-predicate
# covers: spira/lib.sh spira/sentinel.sh spira/chamber/ops.fayth
# hermetic-ok: no database, no systemd; ready_count and SPIRA_SUMMON are stubs
