# attempts.sh — read and repair the two counters that decide whether a bead is retried.
#
#   attempts.sh audit                  what every claimable bead is carrying, and why
#   attempts.sh reclassify [--apply]   move rungs that name no cause onto the reclaim counter
#   attempts.sh deadlocked [--apply]   poisoned beads whose work is finished and would merge
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The attempt counter feeds the poison threshold, and poison takes a bead
# out of circulation permanently. It was default-ALLOW — anything a short list of exemptions
# did not positively excuse was charged as a failure of the WORK — so it recorded worker
# deaths, rate-limit refusals and a worktree deleted under a live aeon as evidence about
# beads nobody had looked at. Counts in the tens accumulated against a threshold of three.
#
# The rule is now default-DENY, and a rung records the outcome that charged it (lib.sh,
# session_outcome / outcome_charges). This tool applies the same rule BACKWARDS: a rung
# carrying no cause predates the requirement to name one, and an unnamed rung is not
# evidence. That is not an amnesty, it is the same statute read in the only direction it can
# be read — UNKNOWN does not charge.
#
# `reclassify` WILL NOT LIFT A POISON. Clearing a false COUNT is arithmetic and needs nobody's
# permission; re-queueing a bead the operator has an open decision about is a different act on
# the strength of "these rungs named no cause", which says nothing about whether the work is
# any good. The label is left exactly where it is and the audit says so.
#
# `deadlocked` is the one command that does lift it, and it does so on much stronger evidence:
# not that the count was wrong, but that the WORK IS FINISHED. A poisoned bead stays open, no
# persona may claim an open bead carrying the label, and the landing pass lands only a closed
# bead — so a poisoned bead whose branch names it and merges cleanly into the base is finished,
# landable work that nothing will ever pick up again. That is a deadlock reached by counting,
# and it is not a judgement about the approach: there is nothing left to judge.
