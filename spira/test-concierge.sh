# Two claims, and the second is the one with teeth.
#
# COMPOSED — concierge.sh renders chamber/concierge.md with every placeholder substituted and
# the statute book appended in full, and REFUSES to start when it cannot. A concierge launched
# without its brief looks identical to a working one from outside, and the way anybody finds
# out is the next violated statute.
#
# NEVER SUMMONED — the sentinel draws from spira_task_fayths and spira_lane_fayths, and
# neither may ever contain it. This one carries its own positive control: an ordinary fayth
# sits in the same fixture chamber and MUST appear, because a test asserting only absence
# passes just as well against a roster that is empty for some unrelated reason
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# No database for the roster half, no network, under a second.
