# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A PROGRAM AND NOT A PARAGRAPH.
# -------------------------------------------------
# A beads database is never public (law-beads-is-never-public). It accumulates internal
# working notes, agent memories and the overseer's own judgement, none of which are code,
# and the harness repository is the one thing here that is meant to be shared. "Remember
# not to commit the database" is a resolution; a program that exits non-zero is a
# mechanism, and this is the one place where the cost of forgetting is a public database —
# one that cannot be un-published by deleting the commit.
#
# TWO ASSERTIONS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ONE TWICE.
#
#   A. SEPARATION — no `.beads/` or `.dolt/` exists on disk inside the harness tree.
#      This deliberately IGNORES .gitignore, because it is a claim about what the checkout
#      IS, not about what git would carry. The harness checkout must not also be the beads
#      project directory, and on at least one installation here it is — whose tracked
#      files are precisely what must not ship: .beads/config.yaml, metadata.json, the
#      Dolt hooks.
#      Ignoring `.beads/` would silence assertion B while leaving that identity intact,
#      which is how a fence reports all-clear on the state it was built to refuse.
#
#   B. EXCLUSION — no path git would carry matches a beads-data pattern. Measured with
#      `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, so the question asked is
#      exactly "could this be committed?" — gitignored runtime junk is not an offence, and
#      a staged file is one whether or not it has landed yet.
#
# THE SCOPE IS DERIVED, NEVER LISTED. The harness tree is found by its own signature — a
# directory holding `boundary`, `gate.sh` and `lib.sh` together. When that directory is the
# repository root the scope is the whole repository, which is the state this bead is
# building towards; while the harness still sits inside the wiki at .claude/spira/ the
# scope is that directory alone. So the same check is correct on both sides of the move
# with no step to remember at the moment of moving — and it stays correct for brain, which
# tracks raw/spira-beads/spira.jsonl and eleven other .jsonl corpora ON PURPOSE, into the
# only repository here that leaves the building and is private.
#
# A REPOSITORY WITH NO HARNESS IN IT IS SAID SO OUT LOUD, exit 3, never a silent pass: an
# empty scope and a clean scope are indistinguishable from the outside, and the wrong one
# reads as all-clear (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# THIS IS FENCE TWO OF THREE, and none of the three is a wall.
#   0. .gitignore     — a stray database cannot be staged by accident
#   1. this, as a pre-commit hook — refuses the commit, and names its override
#   2. this, from gate.sh Layer 1 — refuses the LANDING, which is the fence that survives
#      `git commit --no-verify` and the sentinel's own merge
set -uo pipefail

# The forbidden shapes. Every one of them is beads data or the store beneath it.

# keeps one — and exactly why the harness may not.
