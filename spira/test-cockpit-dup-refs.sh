#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# incident.sh trusts its own dedup; this is the check on the dedup. When dedup breaks, every
# pass files a fresh bead for the same external_ref, and the meter is the thing that notices
# before the operator's queue fills up again (the pattern that produced 38 surplus beads over
# two days, sp-2lfgn).
#
# The meter queries beads labelled spira,incident and groups by external_ref. Any ref that
# appears on more than one bead within the lookback window is a dedup failure; SP_DUP_REFS
# is the count of such refs and SP_DUP_BEADS is the total surplus.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Before asserting
# that the meter reads 0 on a clean database, this suite proves the meter would have reported
# a known duplicate — because a meter that always reads 0 or ? cannot be distinguished from
# one that never reads anything.
#
# TEST AGAINST THE REAL DEPENDENCY (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). The fixture is a
# throwaway database (testdb.sh), not a hand-written mock of bdjson. A mock that models the
# fields we remember would pass even if bdjson changed the field name or the meter stopped
# calling it altogether.
