# test-strand-partition.sh — starved-queue escalations cite only beads from their own
#   partition; a saturated fleet suppresses escalation; slot allocation appears in detail.
#
#   ./test-strand-partition.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-15u9f: a stranded-queue escalation titled [spira,incident] cited a
# bead belonging to spira,qa-sweep. Both parties were right about their own evidence, which
# is the most expensive kind of wrong alarm — contradictory evidence trains the operator to
# disbelieve true ones. The fix: the detail cites beads from the same partition as the
# title (both come from classify_one's filtered `ready` set), and a saturated fleet is
# queue ordering rather than starvation.
#
# FIVE CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   0. POSITIVE CONTROL — free fleet slot, starved partition → classifier DOES produce
#      "starved". Proves the check can fire before we trust its silence in cases 1 and 2.
#
#   1. SATURATED FLEET — every slot held by another partition → "fleet-saturated" info
#      row, NOT "starved". The harness is doing the right thing; do not page the operator.
#
#   2. PARTITION ISOLATION — two partitions starved simultaneously: the escalation for
#      partition A names only partition A's beads, never partition B's. A single-partition
#      test could pass by accident; two partitions prove isolation.
#
#   3. SLOT DETAIL — the starved row names "0 of N slot(s)" and the total-live count, so
#      the operator can confirm the fleet state in one glance without opening the panel.
#
#   4. FREE-SLOT POSITIVE PATH — a fleet with live aeons but spare capacity still
#      escalates, confirming the saturated-fleet suppression is narrowly scoped.
#
# PRE-FIX FAILURE (run against unfixed strand-classify.py):
#
#   FAIL  saturated fleet: fleet-saturated IS emitted: wanted [fleet-saturated] in [starved\t...]
#   FAIL  saturated fleet: starved NOT emitted: did not want [starved] in [starved\t...]
#   FAIL  slot detail: "0 of 3 slot(s)" in starved row: wanted [0 of 3 slot(s)] in [...]
#   FAIL  partition A isolation: sp-pa1 cited in A escalation: wanted [sp-pa1] in []
#   FAIL  partition B isolation: sp-pb1 NOT cited in A escalation: did not want [sp-pb1] in [sp-pb1]
