# test-sending-landstate-assert.sh — the Sending logs an assertion when it reaps a branch
# with no landstate record, and stays silent when a record exists.
#
#   ./test-sending-landstate-assert.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. landing.sh writes $SPIRA_RUN/landstate/$id on every code path that
# processes a branch: gate, rebase conflict, or actual push. A branch that reaches the
# Sending with content already on the base but no landstate record means landing.sh never
# selected it for its loop — a selection bug. That is the shape of sp-qj8n: four
# close/reopen cycles, no landstate entry on any of them. The assertion added to sending.sh
# must fire on the FIRST reap so the anomaly is visible before any reopen cycle.
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST IS A DISTINCTION, NOT A VALUE. Two branches are set up: one with
# no landstate record and one with one. The suite asserts the log line fires for the first
# and not for the second. Without the second case the assertion could fire unconditionally
# and the suite would still pass.
#
# NO DATABASE, and the fixture git state is minimal: a base branch with a commit already on
# it, and a spira/* branch that ancestry says is already contained. content_landed can
# answer YES to a branch that is an ancestor of the base — the simplest shape — so no
# merge-tree machinery needs to be tested here. The assertion is in sending.sh; this suite
# is about when it fires, not about how content_landed reaches its conclusion.
#
# defect: sp-qj8n
# covers: spira/sending.sh
