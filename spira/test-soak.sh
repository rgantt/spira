# THE QUESTION NO OTHER SUITE HERE ASKS. Every other case is about one call: this verdict,
# this reopen, this lock. Every deadlock this harness has shipped was correct in every one of
# those and wrong in their composition — a per-repository flock that was exactly right about
# two gates sharing a tree, and which four hours later had produced 11 consecutive gate runs
# that judged nothing while origin/main sat still for fifty minutes. Nothing in the suite
# could have caught it, because nothing ran two of these programs at once.
#
# THE SHAPE IS TODAY'S, SCALED DOWN. Several aeons gate their own branches concurrently while
# a landing pass on a clock tries to gate and land the same repository — and the landing pass
# allows itself the SMALLEST wait of any caller, deliberately, so it is the one that starves.
# The scaling is honest about what it preserves: the ratio of a gate's runtime to the landing
# pass's patience, which is what decides whether the pass can ever win the tree. Measured on
# 2026-09-07 that ratio was 660s to 120s; here it is 3s to 1s, which is worse.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS IS PROGRESS, NOT ABSENCE. "No deadlock" cannot be observed directly — a
# livelock and a slow queue produce identical logs for any finite window, which is exactly why
# fifty minutes of it read as normal operation. So the claim is positive and measurable: every
# branch reaches a terminal state inside the budget, and the landing pass lands its share
# rather than being starved of the tree by the aeons. A soak that only checked "nothing hung"
# would have passed all morning today.
