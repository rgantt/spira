#
# test-check5-landed-no-delivers.sh — a closed bead whose commit IS on the base and which
#   carries NO delivers: label must be left closed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. This is the case CHECK 5 sees most often — the ordinary bead, worked and
# landed by an aeon, with no delivers: label at all — and on 2026-09-09 it was the case that
# broke, in the direction that destroys finished work.
#
# THE DEFECT. The bulk listing is emitted as delimited columns and read with `read -r`. Bash
# treats TAB as IFS WHITESPACE, so a run of tabs collapses to a single delimiter and an EMPTY
# MIDDLE COLUMN vanishes, shifting every later column left by one. `delivers` is empty on
# almost every bead, so `read` handed it the NEXT column — started_at's ISO timestamp. A
# timestamp is not a recognised delivers type, so CHECK 5 took the delivers branch for beads
# that had declared nothing, charged an attempt and reopened them. Eleven beads were poisoned
# in ninety seconds, every one of them with commits on the base naming it. Demonstrated:
#
#   printf 'a\tb\t\tc\n' | while IFS=$'\t' read -r w x y z; do echo "[$y]"; done   ->  [c]
#
# THE FIX is \x1f as the separator at all three sites — emitter, sort and read — because it is
# not IFS whitespace and empty columns survive it. A placeholder for the empty value would
# have been a convention someone must remember; this makes the shape unconstructible.
#
# WHY THE EXISTING SUITE DID NOT CATCH IT. test-check5-nopayload.sh passes 24/0 against the
# broken code. Every one of its closed beads is EXPECTED to be reopened, or carries a
# delivers: label, so the collapsed column changed only the reason, never the verdict. The
# case that distinguishes them — landed, no delivers, must stay closed — was the one nobody
# wrote. A test that asserts an outcome reached by the wrong route is not covering the route.
