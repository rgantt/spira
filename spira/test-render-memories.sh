# test-render-memories.sh — tiered render_memories: core full text, index slugs.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST (sp-4e69e)
# ------------------------------
# render_memories in lib.sh now renders in two tiers:
#   Core tier   — statutes in SPIRA_STATUTE_CORE render in full (## slug + paragraph).
#   Index tier  — all other statutes render as slug lines under a "bind equally" heading.
#
# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA EXERCISED
# ------------------------------
#   1. Core statute renders in full; non-core renders as slug line; neither missing.
#   2. Count of rendered slugs == count of statutes in force.
#   3. Growth assertion: +1 statute → delta is ONE LINE, not one paragraph.
#   4. Negative control: removing a slug from SPIRA_STATUTE_CORE moves it to the index tier.
#   5. Budget: a core statute too large for the char-budget falls back to index, not vanishes.
#   6. Token count against the live book is not a suite concern; see bead acceptance criteria
#      for the human-verified measurement.
#
# PAIRS (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control): every negative case has a positive pair.
# REAL DB (law-prefer-the-real-dependency): uses testdb.sh, not a stub.
