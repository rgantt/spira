# test-answers-premise-rejected.sh — a premise-rejected close must never render as RYAN ANSWERED.
#
# THE SCAR. answered-since.sh announced four dismissals as "RYAN ANSWERED ... done" on
# 2026-09-10 and a session acted on them as affirmations, enacting statutes and verifying
# "fixes" for things Ryan had refused to be asked about. The bead's close_reason carried the
# prefix `premise-rejected:`, which answers.py did not distinguish from a verdict.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. answers.py is the single implementation behind both answered-since.sh
# (format=session) and watch-answers.sh (format=monitor). Both format paths render verdicts
# and must render rejections distinctly.
#
# EVERY CASE IS A PAIR (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control): the rejection is asserted
# never to produce RYAN ANSWERED beside a regular verdict that is asserted still to. A check
# asserting only absence passes just as well against a broken answers.py that produces nothing.
#
# THE BD STUB. answers.py's closed_by() calls `bd history <id> --events --json`, which the
# embedded binary (bd-embedded 1.2.2) does not support. A stub wraps bd-embedded, handles
# only the history-events call, and delegates everything else — so all database operations
# run against the real throwaway instance (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). What is stubbed
# is a feature the embedded binary lacks for version reasons, not a behaviour we are trying to
# avoid testing.
