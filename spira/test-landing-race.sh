#
#   ./test-landing-race.sh
#
# Both are cases where the pass has already decided the work is good and then trips over its
# own machinery, and both used to end with the pass saying something untrue about a bead:
# once by landing the same branch twice in consecutive passes, once by reopening finished
# work as "conflicts with the base" when nothing had conflicted with anything.
#
#   01:56:04 landing: push rejected, origin/main moved — retry 1
#   01:56:04 ACT landed spira/<id>
#   KEEP   <id>  unlanded — 2 commit(s) not in origin/main      <- the same pass
#   01:56:27 ACT landed spira/<id>
#
# The retry recovered by rebasing the LANDING branch onto the moved base, which replays the
# branch's commits as new objects and leaves the branch ref on the originals. So the work
# landed and the branch was an ancestor of nothing, the reap kept the ref, and the next pass
# merged it again — a no-op merge whose `git push` answers "Everything up-to-date" and exits
# 0, so it reads as a movement and inflates the action count the judgement tier reads.
#
# The database is a REAL bd on a fixture created for the run and dropped by a trap, and git
# is real too, with a real bare remote, because every claim here is a claim about ancestry or
# about what `git merge` and `git push` do when there is nothing left to do. `gate.sh` and
# `confine.sh` are stubs whose exit status this suite dictates: each has its own suite, and
# what is under test here is what landing does AFTER a verdict, not how one is reached.
