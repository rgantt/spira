#
# WHY STATELESS AND SHORT-LIVED
# -----------------------------
# Gas Town's agents are long-lived tmux sessions holding mailboxes, and a session that
# dies takes its work with it — nothing else knows what it held. An aeon holds a LEASE
# instead: if it dies, the lease goes stale and `bd reclaim` returns the bead to ready.
# Crash recovery becomes a property of the substrate rather than of the agent.
#
# WHY `bd ready --claim` AND NOT SELECT-THEN-CLAIM
# ------------------------------------------------
# Selecting and then claiming is a race with every other aeon. `--claim` is atomic and is
# the documented primitive; hand-rolling it would be the "read the manual first" mistake.

# RESUMPTION BEATS INITIATION — WITHIN ONE PRIORITY, NEVER ACROSS ONE. `bd ready --claim`
# takes the first row, and priority was the only ordering — so a bead carrying 21 commits
# and an open pull request lost to a bead with nothing started, twice. That is not untidy,
# it is expensive: an unfinished branch decays, its base moves under it, and every pass it
# sits costs another rebase.
#
# So look for resumable work FIRST: a ready bead whose recorded branch exists and is ahead
# of its base. Claim that one by id, atomically, with `bd update --claim`. Only when there
# is none do we fall back to taking the head of the queue.
#
# THE PRIORITY FLOOR IS THE HALF THAT WAS MISSING, and without it this block was a priority
# inversion that starved every P0 in the queue. The loop took the first RESUMABLE candidate
# at any depth, so one P1 with a single commit on its branch beat seven P0s with nothing
# started — measured 2026-09-07: the queue's head was sp-2tv (P0, the bead describing this
# very starvation) and the loop reached past it to candidate twelve, sp-4vp (P1, one commit
# ahead), on every pass. The operator watched more than five aeons walk over it.
#
# A resumable bead is worth preferring over an unstarted PEER. It is not worth preferring
# over more important work: the decaying-branch cost this block exists to avoid is bounded
# by a rebase, while the cost of never starting a P0 is unbounded. So candidates are
# filtered to the best priority present before the branch test runs, and a lower band is
# reached only when the whole band above it is unstarted — which is exactly when the
# fallback `bd ready --claim` head is already the right bead.
#
# Filtered in python over the whole payload rather than by breaking out of the loop on the
# first priority change, so it does not silently depend on `bd ready` returning rows in
# priority order — an ordering nothing promises and one this file already learned not to
# trust for the claim itself.

# under `set -u` on every beat. That does not kill the beat: the error dies inside the
# command substitution, `now` comes back empty, and empty compares equal to the previous
# empty, so the stall counter read "no progress" on a session doing nothing but progress.

# legitimately long (the operator, verbatim: "why would aeons have a time limit? they should
# exist until they finish their work").
#
# What the timeout was actually guarding is real but narrower: an unconditional heartbeat
# proves the PROCESS is alive, not that WORK is happening, so a wedged session would beat
# forever and hold its lease. So the heartbeat is conditional — but not on log file growth.
#
# LOG GROWTH IS NOT THE SIGNAL. The CLI emits a tool_progress heartbeat every ~30s while the
# model is blocked on a single tool call, and every heartbeat is a line in the log. So a
# fully blocked aeon's log grows steadily, and a size check cannot tell it from one doing
# real work. Measured: an aeon sat 510s inside a single `tail --pid` while the size check
# and the lease both reported it healthy.
#
# THE SIGNAL THAT WORKS is elapsed_time_seconds on the trailing heartbeat — time since the
# model last ACTED — qualified by whether the blocked command's process subtree has started
# anything. The qualification matters: a gate run measured 776s cold, and blocked is not
# stuck. A flock wait for the test fixture is a legitimate queue, not a stall.

# ---- one test fixture for the whole session -------------------------------------------
# WAITING ON TESTS WAS 43% OF A SESSION'S WALL CLOCK and 73% of its tool time, and the
# suites here are not CPU-bound, they are database-bound: `bd init` is nearly all of the
# ~27s (55s under load) each suite spends building its fixture. The landing gate already
# builds ONE and lets every suite reset it instead — 0.2s — but an aeon running suites by
# hand got none, so each of its ~15 single-suite runs paid the full build.
#
# So the aeon builds one too, here, once, and exports it into the session. Every Bash call
# the session makes inherits it, which is the whole mechanism: a suite that sources the
# fixture library sees TESTDB_SHARED and resets rather than rebuilds, with no argument to
# pass and nothing for the session to remember (law-gate-once-fixture-shared).
#
# BUILT FROM THE WORKTREE'S OWN COPY, not the installed one. The tree whose suites will
# consume the fixture is the tree that should build it — the same rule the landing gate
# follows — so a bead that changes what a baseline means changes both halves together.
# A repository with no such file gets no fixture and no error; that is what decides which
# repositories this applies to, rather than a list of names.
#
# AND ALWAYS ITS OWN. Whatever the caller had is cleared before anything else, and only what
# this aeon builds is put back — the landing gate exports one shared fixture to everything it
# runs, so a suite under it that summons an aeon hands that database straight through. Passed
# on, the session would reset a database it does not own, mid-run, while the caller's own
# suites were still reading it, and every one of them would fail for a reason none could name.
#
# THE COST IS ONE BUILD PER SESSION, PAID EVEN BY A BEAD THAT RUNS NO TESTS, and the log
# line below is the meter that says when that stops being a good trade (the number to watch
# is this build against the count of suite runs in the session's own trace).

    PARK_BRIEF="## Your lifetime: do the work, cut the review, then exit

**Do not sit and watch CI.** An Opus session idling for twenty-five minutes while a test
suite runs is the most expensive way to wait that exists. When your work is pushed and its
pull request is open, your job is done for now — exit cleanly and let the harness bring the
bead back when there is something to decide.

What makes that safe is the bead, not your memory of it. Before you exit:

- push your branch, and open or update its pull request
- label the bead \`$SPIRA_CI_LABEL\` — that is the harness's signal that this is parked ON
  PURPOSE and not abandoned, so it is not treated as stalled work
- leave the bead OPEN with a note saying what state it is in and what should happen when
  the run finishes

The sweep then watches that pull request for you. Green and mergeable, it lands and closes
the bead. Red, it clears the label and raises the priority so the next aeon picks the bead
up to fix it — and that aeon is you-in-effect: same bead, same recorded branch, all your
commits, the failure waiting to be read.

A park is not open-ended. One older than \`SPIRA_CI_PARK_MAX\` (${SPIRA_CI_PARK_MAX}s) is
treated as lost rather than parked: the sweep takes the label off and the bead goes back into
the stranded-work report, because a park nothing is watching must not be the one state that
hides a bead from the report that would have found it."
else
    PARK_BRIEF="## Your lifetime: do the work, then exit

**There is no CI run to wait for in this repository.** $REPO_NAME lands by \`$REPO_LAND\`, so
nothing opens a pull request for \`$BRANCH\` and no run will ever report on it. The landing
gate is the only gate, and once it passes there is nothing further to wait for.

**So do not label the bead \`$SPIRA_CI_LABEL\`.** That label means \"parked on a run somebody
else is watching\", and it excludes the bead from every persona's predicate and from the
stranded-work report — the two mechanisms that would otherwise notice the work had stopped.
Applied where no run exists it is a permanent, invisible hold: not claimable, not reported,
and shown to the operator as \"in CI\", which is the one description that stops anybody
looking for the real cause. The sweep strips such a park; do not make it have to.

When the work is committed on your branch, close the bead with its evidence and exit. How the
branch reaches \`$BASE_BRANCH\` from there is described above, and none of it needs you."

# HOW TO RUN THE GATE IS PART OF THE BRIEF, because running it the obvious way does not
# work. The gate outgrew the ceiling an agent's tool puts on a single command: past it the
# tool moves the command to the background and hands back a task id instead of a verdict,
# and no `timeout` the session chooses can move that — the tool's ceiling fires first.
#
# A session that then ends its turn to wait ends the SESSION, and the bead is released
# in_progress with an attempt charged for a race it did not lose. gate-run.sh runs the gate
# detached and waits a bounded slice per call, so the session always holds either a verdict
# or the knowledge that there is not one yet.
#
# The path is rendered rather than named, for the same reason every other path in this brief
# is: an aeon works in a worktree of some repository and the harness is not inside it.
GATE_BRIEF="**Run the landing gate through the runner, never \`gate.sh\` directly:**

    bash $SPIRA_HOME/gate-run.sh $BRANCH $REPO_NAME

The gate takes longer than your Bash tool will run one command. Past its ceiling the tool
moves your command to the background and hands you a task id instead of a verdict — and
ending your turn to wait for that ends this session, which returns the bead unfinished.

The runner starts the gate detached and waits a bounded slice of it, so each call is a real
wait rather than a poll. It exits **0** when the gate passed, **1** when it failed — the
output is printed for you — and **2** when it is still deciding. On a 2, run the exact same
command again; it picks the same run back up rather than starting another.

**Never end your turn while it is unfinished.** The exit path checks: a session that ends
with its gate still running has the bead released with a note saying so, and records no
verdict it did not have.

**If the gate goes red, say which kind of red it was — in one command, at the moment you
know:**

    bash $SPIRA_HOME/yield.sh classify $BRANCH GATE_FAULT \"<what actually broke>\"

\`GATE_FAULT\` when the branch did not cause it — a suite read the state of the box, a fixture
collided, the base was already broken. \`DEFECT\` when the gate was right and you fixed
something. You do not have to: a red you fix and re-gate green is classified for you from the
fact that the tree changed, and a red the gate itself attributes to the base or to its own
machinery is classified on arrival. Say it when you know better than that inference does.

This is the only measurement of whether the gate is worth the minutes it takes from every
branch. A gate whose reds are mostly its own fault gets deleted on this evidence, in a
sentence, instead of after an outage — which is how the last one went."

# ---- the deadline ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A SESSION THAT CAN BE KILLED MUST BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN. A persona that declares
# FAYTH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS is killed from outside — the transient unit's TimeoutStartSec is set
# from that same key — and its brief then asks it, if it cannot finish, to leave what it
# found in the graph rather than in a session that is about to end. It had no way to tell how
# long that was. Measured: four consecutive sessions on one incident, every one killed within
# a second of the wall, and no commit and no bead between them; each had found something and
# each took it with it. The wall is not the defect. Not being able to see it is.
#
# ANCHORED AT AEON_T0, THIS SCRIPT'S OWN START. The wall is on the unit, and by the time the
# prompt is rendered the unit has already spent seconds claiming a bead and building a
# worktree — a countdown started here would be exactly that much too generous, and the number
# the aeon needs is the one it can still spend. Run by hand with no unit around it, only the
# `timeout` on the session below applies and that starts later still, so this reads early
# rather than late; early is the harmless direction.
#
# THE EPOCH IS IN THE TEXT ON PURPOSE. A clock time says when the session dies; the epoch is
# what lets it ASK how much is left, at any point, in one command that depends on nothing
# here. An aeon that has to estimate its remaining time will estimate it generously.

The kill comes from outside the session, on a clock, and it is a wall rather than a request:
work in progress is discarded and anything you learned that is not written down goes with it.
Do not estimate what is left — read it, as often as you need to:

ALREADY_DONE_BRIEF="## If you find the work is already done

If you conclude this bead's work has already landed on \`$BASE\` under another commit — a
different bead already carried it — do **not** close with an \"already done\" reason. The
sentinel verifies landing by reading the commit graph, not the close reason: a bare close
without a commit naming \`$BEAD_ID\` is indistinguishable from a failed attempt, and the
sentinel reopens it and charges an attempt toward the poison threshold.

The machine-readable path:

1. **Verify the successor actually landed.** Closed is not landed — a bead can be closed
   without its commit on the base. Check the commit graph, not the bead's status:

       git -C $WORK log --format='%s' -n \${SPIRA_VERDICT_WINDOW:-400} $BASE | grep <successor-id>

2. Once confirmed on the base, **run \`bd supersede\`**:

       bd -C $SPIRA_DB supersede $BEAD_ID --with <successor-id>

That records the relation so the sentinel, landing pass, and cleanup checks all recognise this
bead as retired and skip it correctly. A close reason alone is not read by any of them."

# THE LAST STEP BEFORE CLOSING IS A REBASE, AND IT IS THE AEON'S. The landing pass rebases
# too, but it cannot resolve a conflict — it reopens the bead and hands the conflict to the
# NEXT aeon, which arrives with none of the context that wrote the commits. With several
# aeons landing, the base moves between an aeon's close and its landing by construction, and
# 12 of the first 23 reopens this harness performed were exactly that. The session that
# holds the context is the one that should pay for the conflict, so it is told to, and the
# verdict step below checks that it did.
CLOSE_BRIEF="## Before you close: rebase onto \`$BASE\`

Other aeons land while you work, so \`$BASE\` has probably moved. The last thing you do
before closing the bead — after your commits, before the close — is:

    git -C $WORK fetch ${BASE_REMOTE:-origin}
    git -C $WORK rebase $BASE

Resolve any conflict yourself: you wrote these commits and you know what they mean, and the
landing pass does not — it would reopen the bead and hand the conflict to a stranger. Then
run the gate once more on the rebased tree, and close. A bead closed behind \`$BASE\` that
does not rebase cleanly is reopened by the harness, which costs a whole second session."

# ---- the closing rule: an incident resolved without a runbook is not resolved ----------
# An incident that leaves no runbook behind is a POISONABLE condition, not a number on a
# pane. The Ops brief has called this rule "not optional" since it was written, and it was
# disobeyed six times in one day — which is the whole difference between an instruction and
# a fence.
#
# THE THREE HONEST ENDINGS, and each is one command (see the persona's own fayth, which is
# where the rule is declared and where they are enumerated):
#
#   nothing on the shelf fit; I diagnosed something new   ->  sop.sh write
#   an SOP fit but was incomplete                         ->  sop.sh write   (the upsert)
#   an SOP fit and its CHECK confirmed                    ->  sop.sh applied --check pass
#
# THE THIRD ROW IS WHAT KEEPS THIS FROM FIRING ON A GOOD SESSION. "The SOP fit, it held, and
# it taught us nothing new" is the outcome a healthy shelf produces most of the time and it
# is creditable; poisoning that session would punish the good case. SILENCE is what is being
# outlawed here, not brevity — and recording the truth is the cheapest of the three ways out
# whatever the truth turns out to be, which is the property that keeps this from becoming a
# gate an aeon satisfies hollowly.
#
# `--held` DOES NOT ENTER INTO IT, deliberately. `--held no` and `--held unknown` are honest
# outcomes of a runbook that genuinely fit, and demanding an amendment on top of one would
# make `--held yes` the cheapest exit — a lie, and one that corrupts the single field the
# whole shelf is measured by. What does not satisfy the rule is `--check fail` alone: that is
# the session's own statement that nothing on the shelf applied, which is row one, and row
# one's exit is a write.
#
# ONLY FOR A PERSONA THAT DECLARES THE RULE. A builder closing a bead without touching an
# SOP is doing exactly its job.
#
# IT DECLINES TO JUDGE WHEN IT CANNOT READ. An unreadable shelf or an unreadable ledger is
# not an absence, and treating one as an absence would poison every incident closed on the
# day the database is down — the day a runbook is worth most (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
