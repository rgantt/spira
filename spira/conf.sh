# conf.sh — the ONE configuration surface. Sourced, never executed.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. Every path this harness touches used to be written into the script
# that touched it: the wiki checkout, the beads database, the directory two binaries happen
# to live in, the seven repositories one operator has. A colleague cloning it has none of
# those, and the failure is not a message — it is `bd: command not found` from a systemd
# timer, into a log nobody reads. So the paths are collected here, in one place, and every
# script asks this file instead of knowing the answer.
#
# THREE SOURCES, IN THIS ORDER, AND THE FIRST ONE THAT SPEAKS WINS:
#
#   1. the ENVIRONMENT — because that is the seam every test suite already drives a fixture
#      through, and a config file that could override a test's own SPIRA_DB would point the
#      suite at the operator's real database. Environment first is not a convenience here;
#      it is what keeps the suites isolated.
#   2. the CONFIG FILE — `spira.conf`, the operator's box.
#   3. a DERIVED DEFAULT — computed from where this file sits, so a clean clone with no
#      config at all still resolves to something coherent rather than to someone else's box.
#
# WHERE THE CONFIG FILE IS LOOKED FOR, first hit wins:
#
#   $SPIRA_CONF                                  an explicit path; set it to a nonexistent
#                                                one to read no file at all
#   $SPIRA_REPO/spira.conf                       beside the checkout the harness runs from
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/spira/spira.conf
#   /etc/spira/spira.conf
#
# IT IS NOT SOURCED. A config file that is shell can set PATH, run a command, or shadow a
# function this library defines, and it is read by a process that summons agents. It is
# parsed as `KEY=value` lines, `#` comments, keys restricted to the ones named below, and
# nothing else is honoured — an unknown key is reported, not obeyed, because a typo that is
# silently ignored is a setting the operator believes is in force.

[ -n "${SPIRA_CONF_LOADED:-}" ] && return 0
SPIRA_CONF_LOADED=1

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every key this harness honours, with the default the CODE carries. A key absent from this
# list is refused when it appears in a config file.
#
# This list is also the allowlist: `spira_conf_read` refuses anything not named here, so a
# misspelled key is reported rather than silently ignored. The defaults themselves live in
# `spira_conf_defaults`, which runs AFTER the file is read, so a default may refer to a key
# the operator set.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SPIRA_HOME AND SPIRA_REPO ARE ABSENT FROM THIS LIST DELIBERATELY, and that is a fence.
# Where the harness IS is not a configuration question — it is a fact about where this file
# sits — and letting a config file answer it breaks the landing gate, which extracts a branch
# to a scratch tree and runs that tree's own suites. The config would point them back at the
# installed copy, so the gate would test the code already in force instead of the code being
# judged, and pass. The environment may still override both: that is the seam every suite
# drives a fixture through, and it is explicit rather than ambient.

# WHAT IS EXPORTED, AND WHAT MUST NEVER BE.
#
# EXPORTED, because the readers are not all shell: a python one-liner, an aeon's session and
# the Rust attention panel are all children of a process that sourced this file, and the
# alternative — threading each value through argv at every call site — is where one gets
# dropped and the tool silently reads a different database.
#
# NOT EXPORTED: EVERYTHING DERIVED FROM WHERE THIS FILE SITS. SPIRA_HOME, SPIRA_REPO, the
# maps, the chamber, the cockpit, the runtime directory. Those differ per COPY of the
# harness, and anything that sources its own conf.sh must resolve them from its own location.
# Exporting them cost eleven tests in one go: a fixture library, sourced by a suite for its
# database helpers, published the live installation's SPIRA_HOME into the environment of the
# sentinel that suite then ran under a temporary one — so the sentinel read the operator's
# REAL repo-map, found none of the fixture's repositories, and landed nothing, while every
# log line it printed looked ordinary (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
#
# It is safe to export the rest precisely because the landing gate runs its trial under
# `env -i`: configuration reaches the harness's own children and stops at the boundary of
# anything being judged.
#
# SPIRA_FAYTHS and SPIRA_MAX_AEONS are also not exported. They are policy for THIS host, read
# in-process, and exporting SPIRA_FAYTHS is the scar that statute is named for — it reached a
# test suite through systemd and made the suite assert the host's roster instead of the
# defaults it was written to check.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE EXIT STATUS THAT MEANS "NO VERDICT", as opposed to "failed". The landing gate withholds
# a verdict when it cannot obtain the tree it judges in, and a caller that reads that as a red
# gate charges a queue to the branch — reopening a finished bead as having "failed the landing
# gate", three of which poison it and escalate to the operator over a lock it never contended
# for. It is a shared constant rather than a literal in the gate and again in its caller,
# because two programs that disagree about this number fail in exactly that direction.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT SETTABLE, and so not in SPIRA_CONF_KEYS: it is the protocol between the
# gate and whoever runs it, not a fact about a host. A configurable one could be set to 0,
# which would turn every withheld verdict into a pass. 75 is EX_TEMPFAIL — "try again" —
# and is outside the range a gate command of its own would return.
SPIRA_GATE_NOVERDICT=75

# FOUR OUTCOMES, AND WHOSE FAULT EACH ONE IS. Every judgement in this harness returns exactly
# one of these, and the caller's whole decision follows from which. Before this there were
# two — 0 and "non-zero" — so a gate that timed out, a gate that could not find its own
# worktree, and a repository whose suites fail on its own base were all delivered to the
# landing pass as "this branch is broken". Each was then fixed by adding one more special
# case at the caller, and the shape recurred five times in two days (sp-p4rl, sp-d21,
# sp-io5j, sp-snyj, sp-1aex).
#
#   PASS       0   judged, and good                     -> land it
#   FAIL       1   judged, and bad                      -> the BRANCH is at fault
#   BASE_FAIL 76   the same suites fail on the base     -> the BASE is at fault
#   NO_VERDICT 75  not judged at all                    -> the MACHINERY is at fault
#
# THE RULE THAT MATTERS: BASE_FAIL and NO_VERDICT may never reopen a bead and never charge an
# attempt. Three charged attempts poison a bead and escalate to the operator, so a lock, a
# timeout or somebody else's red main could — and repeatedly did — walk finished work to
# poison and then report it as the branch's failure.
#
# A JUDGEMENT WITH NO EVIDENCE IS NO_VERDICT BY CONSTRUCTION. A gate killed at its deadline
# printed an empty `tail -20`, which arrived as a bare "failed" with nothing in it to act on
# (sp-p4rl); the one refusal path that printed nothing at all did the same (sp-io5j). FAIL
# has to be able to show its work or it is not a FAIL.
#
# 76 is EX_UNAVAILABLE — "the service is not available" — which is precisely the claim: the
# base this branch must merge into is not in a fit state to judge against.

# told the operator nothing: not which program, not what it is for, not where to get it.
#
# `spira_require` is cheap enough to call at the top of anything — it is a `command -v` —
# and it is the only reason a fresh box gets a sentence instead of a shell error.
