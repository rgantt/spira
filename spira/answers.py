"""answers.py -- what the operator SAID, since the last time anybody looked.

The operator speaks to this harness in exactly two ways, and both are writes to a bead:

  a CLOSE carrying a reason   -- the verdict on an escalation; the reason IS the answer
  a COMMENT on any bead       -- including one they can never close, because an FYI is
                                 created closed and closing it again means nothing

Only the first had a delivery path. A comment on an FYI reached no session at all: the
close-cursor below cannot see one, because a comment does NOT bump the bead's updated_at
and the row `bd list` returns carries `comment_count` but not the bodies. So a reply sat
unread until the operator said so themselves -- the second time the same escalation queue
lost an answer, which is why this is a program and not a note.

WHOSE VOICE. A close made by an agent is indistinguishable from the operator's on the row:
there is no `closed_by` on it, and the Dolt committer is the literal string `beads` whatever
BEADS_ACTOR says. But beads DOES record the actor, in its audit events -- `bd history <id>
--events` yields an event of type `closed` carrying `actor`. That is authoritative and needs
no new convention, so both legs here filter on it: a verdict is reported only when the
operator's own actor name is on the event. Without that a session acts on its own echo, and
the failure is silent because the text of the announcement looks exactly like a real answer.
The panel must therefore CLOSE as the operator, not merely comment as them.

A CURSOR, NOT A TAIL. There is no file to follow; the record is a row. Each leg keeps a
high-water mark and reports only what is past it, so this is quiet when nothing has been
answered -- which is most of the time, and what makes it safe to run from a Monitor or at
session start. A bare timestamp cannot express "reported everything up to this second": two
writes can share one second, and one of them would be replayed forever or lost. So the mark
carries the timestamp AND the keys already reported AT that timestamp. A mark that is gone
while its sibling survives is treated as CLEARED rather than new and adopts the sibling's
position: the remedy for a poisoned state file is to delete it, and seeding at `now` instead
would silently swallow every answer given since the last read.

Reads the bead list on stdin, because which database to address is the caller's decision
and there is one place that decides it. Shells out only for the bodies, one process at a
time: an unbounded fan-out over every bead spawned hundreds of concurrent `bd` processes
against a single server and drove a four-core box into swap.
