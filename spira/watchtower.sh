# watchtower.sh — wake Ops on a timer and hand it the state of the pipeline.

#   watchtower.sh            gather, and file the sweep Ops claims
#   watchtower.sh --show     gather and print; touch nothing
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (law-detection-outranks-rejection). Ops has always been able to hear about
# a unit that CRASHED — incident.sh files from a systemd OnFailure, and that is its only
# intake. A queue that has stopped moving while every unit is happily `active` is invisible
# to it, and that is not a hypothetical: on 2026-09-07 nothing landed for the better part of
# a morning while every process was green, every log line was individually true, and eleven
# consecutive gate runs correctly reported that the next pass would take it. Nothing noticed.
# The operator did, by looking.
#
# So this is the second intake: not "a process died" but "the pipeline is not doing the thing
# it exists to do". What the system IS, stated plainly, is N workers pulling from a DAG into
# a merge queue — so the numbers that matter are the depth of that queue, how long its oldest
# member has waited, and how long it has been since anything came out of the far end.
#
# IT DOES NOT DECIDE (the operator's call, 2026-09-07, over a threshold-driven detector).
# This program gathers and hands over; an Ops aeon reads the snapshot and decides what is
# wrong and what beads to cut. Thresholds anticipate only the outage you already had — every
# stall so far has been a shape nobody had a number for.
#
# THE SESSION IS BOUNDED BY THIS CADENCE, and that constraint lives in ops.fayth: a sweep
# arrives every ten minutes, so an Ops session gets eight. The first live one ran eighteen
# and would have been working the 22:30 snapshot while 22:40 and 22:50 queued behind it. The
# sweep is also deduped to one open at a time, so a cycle arriving while Ops is still working
# the last one bumps a recurrence rather than filing a second.
#
# IT IS DETERMINISTIC AND CHEAP, deliberately (law-deterministic-before-inference). It reads
# files that already exist and shells out to nothing slow, because the one thing a watchtower
# may not be is another thing that is down during an outage.
#
# A FIELD IT COULD NOT READ RENDERS `?`, NEVER 0 (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). A
# broken probe reporting "0 branches waiting" is an all-clear that displaces the suspicion
# which would have prompted a look — the exact failure this whole program is a response to.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE RECORD HAS NO TRAILING NEWLINE, and `read` reports that as failure. land_mark writes

# truncated or empty file cannot satisfy. Do not "fix" this by adding a newline to the
# writer — two readers already depend on the current format and the writer is not wrong.
#
# THE FOUR VARIABLES ARE RESET BEFORE EACH READ, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy:
# `read` leaves the previous iteration's values in place when it fails early, so an

### The Sending — are finished branches leaving?

  An unsent branch belonging to a live in_progress bead is work in flight, not backlog;
  the raw count alone is not a fault. An unadopted ref (a spira/* branch whose suffix
  resolves to no bead) can never be reaped by any rite and is a permanent +1 on a figure
  whose purpose is to trend to zero.

### The menu — run these scans, then look for what they do not cover

A sweep is not only a set of numbers to read. These are the scans that are worth sampling
before anything else, because each answers a question the numbers above cannot.

  bash $SUITES run

    Every \`spira/test-*.sh\` in the tree that the landing gate does NOT run, discovered by
    glob so a new suite is run by existing and a deleted one stops being run. It files a bead
    per red, blocks nothing and reopens nothing, and is budgeted at ${SPIRA_SUITES_BUDGET:-420}s
    so it fits inside your own wall. Worth a pass when a figure below says a timed suite has
    no result or a stale one; skip it when they are all fresh and green.

$suites_block

### The shared checkout — are base branches clean?

  An aeon commit on a base branch bypasses the gate and every landing instrument. A checkout
  ahead of its remote means subsequent worktrees base on a ref nobody else has seen.

${guard_block}

### Can this snapshot be believed?

  collector snapshot age              ${snap_age}s   (stale above ${SNAP_AGE_MAX}s)
