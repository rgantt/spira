#
# WHAT THIS TESTS
# ---------------
# law-ships-for-a-colleague: "The published repo must clone and run." Without a test,
# that claim is aspirational — indistinguishable from the false one. This suite is the
# positive control that makes it meaningful.
#
# Two claims are tested:
#
#   1. SYNTAX: every shipped shell script in the harness parses. A syntax error in any
#      shipped script prevents the harness from starting, and an inventory pass says
#      nothing about parseability. `bash -n` catches it before any runtime, so this
#      runs without a database, an API key, or any operator configuration.
#
#   2. DEFAULTS: conf.sh resolves without any operator config. A harness that requires
#      a config file to start is not "clone and run" — it is "clone, configure, then
#      run". After a clone with no spira.conf, SPIRA_HOME must resolve from conf.sh's
#      own location, and SPIRA_ASK_LABEL must be a generic label that names no operator.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROLS COME FIRST (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
#   For syntax: a script with a deliberate syntax error must be caught before the
#   shipped tree is declared clean — otherwise a bash -n that resolves the wrong
#   directory, or whose glob matches nothing, passes vacuously.
#
#   For defaults: a conf.sh whose SPIRA_ASK_LABEL default names an operator must be
#   caught before the shipped default is declared generic — otherwise a check that
#   never read the key would pass just as well.
