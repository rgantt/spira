# test-cockpit-layout.sh — ensure detaches idle ghost clients and window height stabilises.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. Ghost clients (terminals idle for days but still
# attached to the tmux server) drove the cockpit's NEXT/RECENT sections to flap between
# ~5 and ~14 rows on every tick. With window-size latest, a ghost that became "latest"
# shrank the shared window to its small terminal height until the live client regained
# "latest". layout.sh ensure now detaches clients idle longer than
# COCKPIT_CLIENT_IDLE_SECS (default 6 h); layout.sh up sets window-size largest so the
# biggest client's height governs regardless of which client was most recently active.
#
