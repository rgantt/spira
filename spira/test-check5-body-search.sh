# test-check5-body-search.sh — CHECK 5 does not reopen a bead when:
#   (a) its commit is deep in history (beyond any window-based search), or
#   (b) its bead id appears only in the commit body, not the subject line.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. sp-d9x93 exposed two defects in CHECK 5's original implementation:
#
#   1. WINDOW DEFECT. The original search used -n 400 (a 400-commit window). A bead whose
#      commit was commit 401 from the tip was invisible to the search, so CHECK 5 reopened
#      it as closed-without-landing. sp-a9g hit this at commit 401, sp-37q at 400. The fix
#      removed the window entirely: git log now walks the full ancestry.
#
#   2. BODY DEFECT. The original search used --format='%s' (subject line only). A bead id
#      that appears only in the commit body — e.g. in a sentence, or under a "Closes:" line
#      — was not found, so CHECK 5 reopened it. sp-m0s7 was affected. The fix changed the
#      format to '%B' (full commit message including body).
#
# BOTH DEFECTS WOULD HAVE CAUSED THIS SUITE TO FAIL had it run against the unfixed code.
# Proof: the unfixed sentinel uses `landed()` from lib.sh, which has
#   git log --format='%s%n%b' -n "${SPIRA_VERDICT_WINDOW:-400}" $refs
# With SPIRA_VERDICT_WINDOW=1 (simulating the window) and a commit 2 back, the BOUNDARY
# case produces: FAIL body-only NOT reopened: wanted [closed] got [open]
# With --format='%s' on a body-only commit, the BODY case fails identically.
# Both were verified against a patched copy before this test was committed (sp-hv6qu).
#
# CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL — a closed bead with no commit IS reopened (proves CHECK 5 fires).
#   2. BODY-ONLY — the bead id appears only in the commit body; NOT reopened.
#   3. DEEP HISTORY — the bead's commit is 401+ commits back from HEAD; NOT reopened.
#      With the old 400-commit window this bead would have been falsely reopened.
#

# covers: spira/sentinel.sh spira/lib.sh
# hermetic-ok: uses a fixture database and a local git repo, no systemd or gh
