# capacity.sh — the account's five-hour window: is it shut, and which attempts did it cost?
#
#   capacity.sh status              is a pause in force, and until when
#   capacity.sh scan                every session log whose session the account refused
#   capacity.sh reclassify          what would be given back (changes nothing)
#   capacity.sh reclassify --apply  give it back
#   capacity.sh pause <seconds>     shut the window by hand, for a drill or a known outage
#   capacity.sh resume              lift a pause early
#
# WHY RECLASSIFY IS EVIDENCE-DRIVEN AND NOT A LIST OF IDS
# ------------------------------------------------------
# An attempt charged for an outage is a false attempt and should be given back. The obvious
# way to do that is to name the beads that look worst and subtract — and it is wrong, because
# nothing in the count says WHY it was charged. This bead was filed naming six beads and
# ~177 attempts as capacity-caused on the strength of a `grep` for `429` and `503` in their
# logs; those strings are in the logs, in five-digit token counts (`cache_read_input_tokens`
# ending 429), and not one of them is an HTTP status. Subtracting on that reading would have
# handed attempts back to beads that genuinely failed, and un-poisoned work that is poisoned
# for good reason.
#
# So this reclassifies exactly what it can still SEE: a bead whose surviving session log
# ends in an account refusal gets one attempt back. It refuses to reason about the rest, and
# `scan` prints the same evidence so the refusal is checkable rather than asserted.
#
# THE HORIZON IS ONE ATTEMPT DEEP, and deliberately so. The log keeps every attempt now, but
# what is being asked here is whether THIS bead's latest session was refused, and an older
# segment answers a question about a window that has already reopened — so scan reads only
# the last one, through capacity_reset_at. Earlier segments are there to be read by a person
# asking what happened; they are not evidence about the attempt now on the ladder. The fix
# that matters is still the one in aeon.sh that stops charging the attempt in the first
# place, and this is only the cleanup behind it.
#
# EVIDENCE OUTLIVES THE WITHDRAWAL IT JUSTIFIES, so this keeps a ledger. A log that ends in
# a refusal is still there tomorrow, and a cleanup with no memory of itself reads it as
# grounds for a second withdrawal, then a third — attempt counts walking down to zero, after
# which nothing can ever poison however genuinely it keeps failing. Nothing calls this on a
# timer, which is not a defence: a hand-run cleanup command invites being run again. Each
# withdrawal is therefore marked against the fingerprint of the log that justified it, under
# `$SPIRA_RUN/capacity-withdrawn/<id>`, and a re-run is a no-op until a NEW refusal appends
# to that log. Delete a mark to have its log reconsidered.
