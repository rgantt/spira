# session.sh — the coding agent's SessionStart hook: what is watching, what is unread, and
# how to latch onto it. Registered by `install-session-hook.sh`.
#
# WHY A HOOK CAN ONLY PRINT. A command hook communicates with the client through stdout,
# stderr and an exit code, and through nothing else — it cannot call a tool, so it cannot
# attach the Monitor that would deliver a watcher's events. The split that follows is the
# whole design: the OUTER HARNESS owns the watcher processes, systemd keeps them alive, and
# this prints the few facts a fresh context needs plus the command that re-latches. The
# processes are the part that matters; re-latching is ergonomics, and nothing is lost in the
# gap, because the cursor is a file and the log is append-only.
#
# IT PRINTS A SUMMARY, NEVER A REPLAY. Everything here lands in a context window that has
# just opened, which is the most expensive place text in this harness can go. An earlier
# version of this idea told a real session "there are 283 unread events, replay them with
# <drain>", which would have put 283 raw lines into the first screen of a fresh session. So
# the output is held to SPIRA_HOOK_LINES, and held by MEASUREMENT rather than by estimate:
# the table and the latch commands are assembled first and the preview is given exactly what
# is left.
#
# AND IT PEEKS RATHER THAN DRAINS. `drain` marks what it prints as read; under a line budget
# that would destroy every event there was no room for, and it would do it precisely when
# there are most of them. `peek` records nothing, so the latch that follows still replays the
# entire backlog.
#
# NO WATCHERS MEANS NO OUTPUT. This is registered in the client's own settings file, so it
# runs in every session on the box whatever repository that session is in. A harness with an
# empty manifest therefore prints nothing at all — a banner in every session for a thing the
# operator does not use is exactly the noise this replaced.
#
# IT ALWAYS EXITS 0. A SessionStart hook that exits non-zero is surfaced to the user as a
# hook error, and a watcher summary is never worth a broken session start.
#
# THIS DIRECTORY ALSO SERVES AS git's `core.hooksPath`, which is why this file has a suffix
# and the git hooks beside it do not: git resolves a hook by its exact name, so anything named
# after one — `pre-commit`, `pre-push` — becomes a git hook whatever it was written for. Give a
# client hook a `.sh` name and the two cannot collide.
set -uo pipefail

# AN AEON MUST NEVER SEE THIS OUTPUT. aeon.sh exports SPIRA_AEON into every session it
# summons, and this hook fires for every Claude session on the box. An aeon that sees the
# latch block obeys it — it attaches a persistent Monitor, which holds its session open for
# the timeout after the work is done, blocking landing for as long as the lease is held.
# Worse, the Monitor's cursor advances as it reads, consuming the operator's verdicts and
# marking them delivered to a session that cannot act on them.

# RESOLVED FROM THIS FILE, NEVER FROM THE WORKING DIRECTORY. A session starts in whatever
# repository the operator is in, so cwd says nothing about where the harness is; conf.sh
# derives SPIRA_HOME from its own location, which is the only stable answer. It is also why
# the registered command must be an absolute path.

# SessionEnd has nothing to say and nowhere to say it — the context it would print into is

# `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` or `fork`, and every one of them is a context window
# that has just opened with no Monitor attached — which is the only condition this output is
# about. Branching on it could only ever print less on some of them.

# failed, NOT INSTALLED when a row names something this installation has not configured. So
# the table is read as the region BETWEEN the header and the first blank line, and never as
# "everything after line one", and every block below it is read by its own heading.
#
# The difference is not cosmetic. When the latch block was generated from field one of these
# lines, taking the tail of the whole output swept the `DEGRADED` banner and each
# `  <name>: <why>` line in as rows, and emitted `watchd.sh tail DEGRADED` and
# `watchd.sh tail answers:` — latch commands naming watchers that do not exist, in the one
# block whose whole purpose is to be pasted and run. The block is generated from `manifest`
# now, for the reason given where it is read; the table's own boundary still matters, because
# what is printed as the table is taken from here.

# reading the wrong database is silent in exactly the way a watcher with nothing to say is
# silent, so the one fact that separates them is said in its own right rather than left in a
# column to be noticed (law-alerts-must-be-actionable). `status` already lifts it out AND
# carries the reason the probe gave; re-deriving it from the row would reproduce the word
# without the why, which is the half that says what to do next.
#
# AND IT ENDS AT THE BLANK LINE, because DEGRADED is not the last section. `status` prints a
# further block naming watchers this installation has not configured — a fact, not a fault —
# and taking "everything after the word DEGRADED" swept that heading and its rows into the
# call-out, reporting an unconfigured watcher as running and blind. An alert that is not
# actionable is the thing that makes the actionable ones unreadable, and this is the one
# section here whose entire value is that everything in it is a fault.

# The table is a rendering, and its second column is a unit state; inferring a kind from it
# would be guessing at a fact that is stated plainly one command away.
#
# A ROW OF KIND `off` IS NOT LATCHABLE. It names a watcher this installation has not
# configured, so nothing will ever write its log: `watchd.sh tail` refuses it, and a hand-run
# `tail -F` would wait forever on a file with no writer, which from a Monitor is
# indistinguishable from a watcher that is running and quiet.
