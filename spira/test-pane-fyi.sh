# test-pane-fyi.sh — FYI framing and insight lifecycle, targeted Rust checks.
#
#   ./test-pane-fyi.sh
#
# WHAT IT DOES. Runs the panel's Rust tests that verify the two properties
# sp-pane-insights-fyi required, by name. test-panel.sh runs the full cargo
# test suite on a schedule; this suite names the subset so "which tests prove
# the FYI view is correct?" has a direct answer in the suite list.
#
# The two properties:
#
#   FRAMING — insights carry no decide-shaped affordance:
#     fyi                  all tests whose name contains "fyi" (tab label,
#                          footer, reader footer, turn marker, empty state,
#                          dismissed tab rename)
#     why_it_matters       rule beneath the thread names the body "why it matters"
#     insight              all tests whose name contains "insight" (body cleanup,
#                          lifecycle, undismissed visibility)
#     enacted              promoted insights carry § and cite their statute
#     statute              the compose row says "statute" over an enact prompt
#
#   LIFECYCLE — a dismissed insight leaves the pane and stays retrievable:
#     dismiss              all dismiss/restore/archived tests
#     promoted             a promoted row is not a dismissed one
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL: running an empty filter would silently pass with 0 tests.
# The suite fails if cargo reports fewer than 15 tests run — the minimum count
# of the named subset. This catches a stale filter or a renamed test before the
# timed run lets it pass quietly.
#
# WHERE IT RUNS: the TIMED set, like test-panel.sh. They are complementary:
# test-panel.sh proves nothing broke; this suite proves the specific properties
# named in the bead's acceptance criteria.
