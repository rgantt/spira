# test-poison.sh — does the poison valve cover every bead the summoner can dispatch?
#
#   ./test-poison.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES. There were two predicates for "which beads are ours" and they
# disagreed. Summoning goes through fayth_ready, which asks each persona its own
# FAYTH_LABELS; the valve that stops a bead failing forever iterated the goal epic's
# children. A bead carrying a partition's labels but parented outside the goal was therefore
# dispatchable and unpoisonable — summoned every pass, failing every time, never reaching the
# valve that exists to stop exactly that. Measured on one live database: 8 children examined
# standing for 66 beads dispatched, with one bead at 9 attempts against a threshold of 3.
#
# EVERY CASE HERE IS A PAIR, because the whole defect is a set that LOOKS complete. Each
# poisoned bead is also asserted absent from goal_open_children — that is the proof the old
# code could not have found it — and each bead the valve must leave alone is paired with one
# it must take (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# AND THE STATUS FILTER IS NOT THE BUG, which matters because a fix aimed at it would change
# nothing and read as a fix. goal_open_children returns every non-closed child, in_progress
# included; the first assertion below is what rules that out before anything else.
#
# The database is a REAL bd on a fixture dropped by a trap, because what is under test is
# which beads a query returns and a model of bd would be a second implementation of the
# thing in question (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). The sub-programs ARE stubs: what they
# do is not under test here, only which beads the valve reaches.
