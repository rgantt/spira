# test-unclaimable-bead.sh — detect_unclaimable_ready surfaces ready beads no persona can claim
#
# THE DEFECT. sp-f8vry was closed with the detection explicitly not built: "PERMANENT FIX
# NEEDED: Add detection in sentinel CHECK 7 to identify ready beads with no claimable
# persona." The commit it cited (c87909a) asserted only "bead created successfully" — a
# tautology. Seven P1 beads carried fayth:ops on spira,plan labels for fifteen hours while
# the sentinel reported every partition empty, truthfully, on every pass.
#
# THE FIX. detect_unclaimable_ready (lib.sh) reads all ready beads without a partition
# filter, tests each against the full chamber using the same claimers() arithmetic as
# bead.sh, and emits UNCLAIMABLE for any with an empty intersection. It distinguishes an
# idle queue (no beads) from a blocked one (beads present, none claimable).
#
# TWO FAILURE MODES:
#   1. fayth:<persona> on partition labels that persona does not own — the fifteen-hour
#      strand: builder matches the labels, is excluded by the preference; the named persona
#      (ops) is excluded by its own partition. Intersection: empty.
#   2. spira with no partition label — a bead invisible to every persona by construction.
#
# BEFORE THIS FIX, running this suite printed "0 passed, 1 failed" because bd create
# rejected --status (unknown flag) and the test never reached any real assertion.
# After: all cases pass.
