# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO:
#   It does NOT close a bead as unwanted. Unwanted is a product decision about
#   what the system should do, and it belongs to Ryan by the escalation policy.
#   This refusal is in this code, not in a sentence in the brief.
#
#   It does NOT re-prioritise. Priority management is Ryan's or the scheduler's.
#
# SPLIT AND MERGE:
#   Split and merge are compositional operations the aeon performs by calling bd
#   create (for new pieces), supersede (for the original) and this script. They
#   do not have their own subcommands because they are not atomic operations —
#   they are sequences, and each step records its own evidence on the bead.
#
# EXIT:
#   0  success
#   1  usage error / missing required argument
#   2  refused: the operation violates groomer policy
#
