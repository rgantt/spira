# test-ask-help.sh — ask.sh --help prints usage and creates nothing; flag-like titles refused.
#
#   ./test-ask-help.sh
#
# THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. `ask.sh insight --help` treated --help as the insight's
# title and created a bead titled '--help', which was immediately closed (because insights are
# created closed) and appeared in the operator's dismissable list as a record titled "--help".
# The same defect on `add` and `decide` is worse: those verbs create OPEN beads labelled
# needs-ryan, so a mistyped help flag placed a live question in front of the operator.
#
# A check that verifies only the exit code would pass while the bead is still made — which is
# exactly what happened before this suite. The count before and after is the discriminating
# fact (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
