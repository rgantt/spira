# test-scope-label.sh — SPIRA_SCOPE_LABEL is a runtime key, not a literal.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE VERIFIES
# 1. Default (SPIRA_SCOPE_LABEL=spira): builder predicate is spira,plan — unchanged behaviour.
# 2. Custom value: builder predicate becomes that value + plan; spira,plan is NOT the predicate.
# 3. Empty value: builder predicate is plan alone; no predicate contains an empty label
#    (a leading comma would match nothing, looking exactly like "no work ready").
# 4. fayth_fenced passes when the scope label is present, fails when it is absent,
#    and passes unconditionally when the scope label is empty.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL (item 2) IS CRITICAL. A predicate that ignores the key entirely
# still passes "default=spira,plan" and "custom label is claimable". Only the second
# half of item 2 — "spira,plan is NOT the predicate under a custom key" — distinguishes
# a working implementation from a no-op.
#
# defect: law-scope-is-a-runtime-key (sp-9xsjm)
# covers: spira/conf.sh spira/lib.sh spira/chamber/*.fayth
# hermetic-ok: no database, no systemd; fayth_get and fayth_fenced are tested from lib.sh
