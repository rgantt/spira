#   aeons.sh                  what the ceiling is, what is live, what the real ceiling is
#   aeons.sh set <n>          allow at most <n> aeons at once, across every persona and lane
#   aeons.sh unset            remove the fleet ceiling (back to pool + one per lane)

#
# WHY THIS IS A TOOL AND NOT A LINE IN A FILE
# -------------------------------------------
# "Run fewer aeons" is a routine operational wish and it had no lever, so it was answered by
# hand-editing spira.conf — and answered WRONG twice, because the obvious key is not the one
# that governs. SPIRA_MAX_AEONS is the TASK pool; ops, qa and groomer are lanes and draw
# outside it by design, so a host set to a pool of 1 summoned a builder and an ops aeon in
# the same second (2026-09-09 21:46:47) while its own log read `pool: 1 slot(s)`. Anybody
# reaching for "one aeon" has to know that lanes exist, find their caps, and do arithmetic.
# That is a rung-4 problem: a program that refuses to be misread beats a paragraph that
# explains the trap (law-bake-rules-into-tools).
#
# So `status` always prints BOTH numbers and the sum they imply, and `set` writes the key
# that actually binds.
#
# THE CEILING TAKES EFFECT ON THE NEXT PASS, WITH NO RESTART. conf.sh is sourced per pass by
# the sentinel, so the new value is read within ~2 minutes. Nothing needs reloading, and a
# running aeon is never touched — this changes what may be SUMMONED, not what is alive
# (the harness does not halt live work to satisfy a lowered ceiling; see slay.sh for that).
#
# IT DOES NOT EDIT A CONFIG FILE IT DID NOT FIND. The path comes from conf.sh's own
# resolution ($SPIRA_CONF_FILE), never a hardcoded ~/.config path, so this writes to the
# file the harness actually reads — including on a host that keeps it beside the checkout
# or in /etc (law-every-path-comes-from-conf).
