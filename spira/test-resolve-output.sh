#
#   ./test-resolve-output.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPRODUCES (sp-ve5s). cockpit/resolve.sh discarded both stdout and stderr
# of the inner `bd close` invocation, so a database-wide write refusal — bd exits 0 and
# prints the complaint to STDOUT — appeared only as "failed to close <id> in <db>" with no
# cause. A five-turn hunt traced the real message; this suite ensures it propagates.
#
# THREE CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   1. bd fails with a known complaint on stdout → resolve.sh surfaces that text on stderr.
#   2. bd fails with a known complaint on stderr → resolve.sh surfaces that text on stderr.
#   3. bd succeeds → resolve.sh exits 0 and emits no failure text (healthy path stays silent).
#
# Driven through BD_BIN and COCKPIT_DB overrides — no database build, under a second.
