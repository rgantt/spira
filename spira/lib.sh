# aeon.sh writes its pidfile only after it has claimed a bead (aeon.sh:509), while
# systemd-run returns the moment the transient unit exists — so within a single sentinel
# pass an aeon summoned one second ago is invisible to any pid-file count. A ceiling built
# on that count does not clamp the second summon of the same pass, which is precisely the
# lag that let a pool of one run a builder and an ops aeon in the same second on
# 2026-09-09 21:46:47. The unit is authoritative the instant it is asked for.
#
# THE PID FALLBACK IS FOR SUITES, not for production: a test overrides SPIRA_SUMMON with a
# stub, no unit is ever created, and a systemd count would be 0 forever — a ceiling that
# never binds and never says so. Counting pid files there keeps the ceiling testable, and
# the lag does not apply because a stub does not race.

# READY_ARGS — the ONE definition of "a bead an aeon can take". Everything that counts
# candidates, lists them or claims one reads this array, so the count the sentinel summons
# on and the query the aeon claims through cannot ask different questions. Copies of a
# predicate agree only until somebody edits one of them, and the disagreement presents as a
# healthy queue.
#
# `--limit 0` is not optional. `bd ready` pages at 100 and silently drops the rest, and an
# installation that imported a predecessor's beads sorts thousands of them above every native
# plan bead — the plan read as having no workable step at all until this was found.
#
# `--exclude-type epic` is not optional. The goal epic has no blockers, so it reads as ready
# and would be claimed and "implemented", which is not a thing an epic means.
#
# `-u` is not optional, and it is the hardest of the three to see. `bd ready` counts a bead
# by status and blockers; `bd ready --claim` refuses one already carrying another actor's
# assignee. So a bead orphaned by a dead aeon is counted forever and taken never. Measured
# 2026-09-06: 13 plan beads were open, unleased and assigned to aeons that no longer existed,
# and CHECK 7 summoned an aeon every two minutes to report idle within one second. Both
# programs were right and they were answering different questions; `-u` makes it one
# question (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control — a "ready" that cannot be claimed is worse
# than a zero, because it reads as a healthy queue).
#
# claim.pools is unset on this installation, so nothing is legitimately pre-assigned to an
# alias an aeon could still claim. If that ever changes, this is the line that must learn
# about it: `-u` would then hide pool work that `--claim` would happily take.
#
# `--label SPIRA_SCOPE_LABEL` is included when the key is non-empty, keeping beads from
# other repositories out of every count, claim and strand report. An empty key means the
# operator has explicitly disabled scope restriction; the ready set is then unrestricted,
# which is the correct behaviour for a fleet with no scope boundary. The same convention
# appears in fayth_scope_check (lib.sh) and orphan_claims. When this filter is active,
# detect_unclaimable_ready will never see a bead missing the scope label — bd ready itself
# has already excluded it — so the label check inside that function is only reached in

# check2_protect_waiting — protect IN_PROGRESS beads blocked solely on operator-ask deps
# from the time-based dead-worker reaper (CHECK 2 in sentinel.sh).
#
# An aeon that exits because its bead's only open dep carries the ask label is not a dead
# worker — it followed its contract: "record state and exit". Its lease goes stale and the
# time-based reaper fires, finds an IN_PROGRESS bead with a stale lease, and reclaims it.
# The next aeon re-derives the same diagnosis and exits, and the 180m loop repeats. The
# reclaim is wrong: sp-mfa4 hit it six times before this fix existed.
#
# The fix: mark qualifying beads with SPIRA_RECLAIM_SKIP_LABEL so the reaper's
# --exclude-label flag skips them. Remove the label when the dep closes, which lets the
# reaper reclaim the stale lease on that same pass — no latency, no polling.
#
# TWO STEPS, ONE PASS, BATCHED:
# (a) Beads already carrying the skip label: re-check. If no open dep still carries the
#     ask label, remove the skip label so the reaper can fire normally.
# (b) IN_PROGRESS beads with deps but no skip label: if ALL open deps carry the ask label
#     (and there is at least one), apply the skip label.
#
# CONSERVATIVE: only marks when EVERY open dep carries the ask label. One open dep without
# it means other blockers exist; the bead is handled by normal reclaim or claim paths, and
# protecting it would mask a genuine dead-worker case.

# THE POOL IS A BATTLE PARTY (the operator, 2026-09-07: "i have a tank, a healer, and then as
# much DPS as i can"). SPIRA_MAX_AEONS is the party size, and every persona is one of two
# kinds:
#
# THE DISTINCTION IS YUNA AND IFRIT (the operator, 2026-09-07: "as i travel around Spira with
# my party, i have Yuna the summoner always around, but Ifrit the Aeon is only around during
# combat when i NEED Ifrit"). A party member travels with you; an aeon is called for the
# fight and dismissed after it. Ops is Yuna — persistent, always present, not summoned for a
# task. A builder is Ifrit — summoned onto one bead, and gone when it is done.
#
#   PARTY MEMBERS (FAYTH_ROLE=party) — the tank and the healer. They are NOT drawn from this
#   pool, because they are not task-specific work: they are persistent roles that are always
#   present, with their own summoner (Ops has spira-ops.timer). Ops is the healer. Keeping it
#   out of the pool is what actually guarantees it a place — a reserved slot inside a shared
#   pool is still a slot somebody has to release, and builders hold theirs for ~10 minutes (p50 9.4 min, p90 18.6 min measured over 28 runs).
#
#   TASK FAYTHS (the default) — summoned for one bead and gone. This pool is theirs alone.
#   FAYTH_ELASTIC means "no number of your own, take what is left": builders are the DPS, and
#   "as much as I can" is exactly the right cap for them.
#
# WHERE THE METAPHOR DIVERGES, deliberately: in the game one fayth yields one aeon, so a
# party of three builders would need three statues in the chamber. Here a fayth is the CLASS
# — a persona definition — and an aeon one summoned instance of it, which is what lets
# FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT exist at all. Lore-exact would buy nothing but three near-identical
# .fayth files to keep in step.
#
# A PARTY MEMBER SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESENT, which is the part that is not in this file: Ops
# is only summoned when an incident bead is waiting, so a quiet hour means the healer is not
# in the party at all and the role exists only on paper. watchtower.sh is what keeps it
# seated — it hands Ops the pipeline's vital signs on a timer whether or not anything has
# crashed, so the persistent role has something to be persistent about. Until now it was a documented, validated
# configuration key that NOTHING READ — no default, no enforcement, unset on this host — so
# there was no pool at all: every persona had its own private cap and nothing coordinated
# them. Ops could take one and the builder three whether or not the box could carry four,
# and an on-call persona had no more claim on a slot than a feature worker.
#
# The order in SPIRA_FAYTHS IS the priority. Each persona takes up to its own
# FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT from what the ones before it left, so the first one named can never be
# crowded out by work that is merely plentiful — which is the whole point of putting Ops
# there. A persona declaring FAYTH_ELASTIC=1 ignores its own cap and takes the remainder,
# which is what "builders scale to fill" means; it belongs last.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO RESERVATION MECHANISM. The first version of this gave Ops a reserved slot
# inside the shared pool, because ordering alone only stops a builder taking a slot AHEAD of
# Ops within one pass and does nothing about builders already inside ~10-minute sessions.
# Taking party members out of the pool entirely is the simpler answer to the same problem and
# has no arithmetic to get wrong: a role that never competes cannot be starved.
# THE POOL IS A CEILING, NOT A FLOOR. It only ever lowers what a persona may start, so a
# host that sets nothing behaves exactly as before.

# API CAPACITY — the account's own five-hour window, and the third unrelated thing in this
# harness called "capacity".
#
# The other two: FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT is how many aeons may run at once, and the governor's
# budget is CPU, memory and disk. Neither has anything to do with this one, which is whether
# the API will answer at all. The name collision is why the condition went unhandled for so
# long — `grep capacity` returned confident, irrelevant hits.
#
# WHAT GOES WRONG WITHOUT THIS. aeon.sh takes the session's exit code and any non-zero
# becomes a failed attempt, so a session the API refused to serve is recorded as work that
# could not be done. That is not merely a miscount: attempts poison at a threshold, so an
# outage does not just stop the queue, it DESTROYS it — every bead claimed while the window
# is spent burns an attempt for a condition that has nothing to do with its work, and beads
# leave circulation permanently for a fault that heals itself in minutes. A transient
# condition must not be able to write permanent state.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATING FIELD IS `status`, AND IT IS NOT `overageStatus`. Every session on this
# account emits `"overageStatus":"rejected","overageDisabledReason":"org_level_disabled"` on
# EVERY rate_limit_event, including at 7% utilization, because overage is disabled at the
# organisation level as a standing configuration. Keying on it — which the shape of the
# payload invites — would pause the harness permanently and for ever, at full health. Of 460
# rate_limit_events captured across 40 session logs here, 443 read `status: allowed`, 16
# `allowed_warning`, and exactly ONE `status: rejected` — at `utilization: 1`, ending in a
# synthetic assistant turn reading "You've hit your session limit · resets 12pm (UTC)".
# That one event is the positive
# control this detector is tested against (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# AND `429`/`503` ARE NOT IN THESE LOGS AT ALL. A bare grep for them matches four and five
# digit token counts — `"cache_read_input_tokens":142902` contains `429` — which is how one
# log was read as holding "24x 429 and 12x 503" when it holds neither. The stream-json trace
# never carries a bare HTTP status; the refusal arrives as the rate_limit_event above and as
# `is_error` on the terminal `result` record. Match the structure, never the substring.

# THE WITHDRAWAL LEDGER — which refusal has already been paid back.
#
# Giving an attempt back is driven by evidence that stays on disk: a session log ending in
# an account refusal. Evidence that stays is evidence that can be read twice, so a cleanup
# with no memory of itself withdraws a second attempt from the same log on its second run,
# a third on its third, and attempt counts walk to zero — after which nothing can ever
# poison, however genuinely it keeps failing. Nothing calls that cleanup automatically,
# which is not a defence: a hand-run command invites being run again.
#
# THE MARK IS KEYED ON THE LOG'S CONTENT, not on the bead and not on a date. The horizon is
# one attempt deep by construction — aeon.sh truncates `$SPIRA_RUN/<id>.log` on every
# attempt — so "has this refusal already been paid back" is exactly "is this the same log I
# paid back last time". A NEW refusal rewrites the file, the fingerprint moves, and the next
# withdrawal is made. A bead keyed mark would refuse the second outage; a dated one would
# turn the erosion back on after however long it waited.
#
# Losing the ledger costs one duplicate withdrawal per refused log and nothing worse, which
# is why it lives under SPIRA_RUN beside the logs it describes rather than in the database.
# It needs no config key for the same reason the traces do not: the harness put it there.

# THREE COUNTERS, BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE FAILURES AND THEY WANT DIFFERENT ANSWERS.
#
#   sp-attempt-N   the WORK was tried and did not land. Feeds the poison threshold.
#   sp-reclaim-N   the WORKER died holding the bead. Diagnostic; feeds nothing that stops
#                  a bead being worked.
#   sp-requeue-N   the HARNESS put finished work back. The session committed and closed the
#                  bead, and a rebase onto a base that had moved underneath it no longer
#                  replayed — so the bead was reopened and the next aeon inherits the
#                  conflict. Diagnostic; feeds nothing.
#
# The third exists because the first two cannot express it and the first one was taking it.
# A session that finishes, closes, and is reopened over a rebase looks from the counter's
# side exactly like a session that ran to its own end leaving the bead open — `unlanded`,
# which charges. One bead was charged all eight of its attempts that way over work that
# later landed unchanged, and another was poisoned nineteen hours after the session that
# finished it, with a branch that merged cleanly the whole time. Poisoning is permanent and
# a poisoned bead stays OPEN while the landing pass lands only CLOSED beads, so that is a
# deadlock arrived at by counting, with nothing wrong with the work.
#
# It is a COUNTER and not merely an exemption because a bead that has cycled eight times is
# a fact worth seeing: the queue is manufacturing conflicts faster than the work can absorb
# them, and without a number nobody would know (law-take-the-simple-fix-with-a-meter).
#
# They were one counter, and one aeon dying cost a bead TWO of its three attempts: the
# teardown bumped on the way out and strand.sh bumped again when it reclaimed the same bead
# after the lease expired. Beads were poisoned without their work ever having been tried —
# the sessions were refused by the API seconds in. Poison then fires hardest during
# infrastructure flapping, which is exactly when the queue can least afford to lose work.
# "This bead cannot be worked" and "this host keeps killing aeons" are different claims and
# neither is evidence for the other.
#
# Kept as labels rather than metadata because a label is visible in every listing and
# filterable by the same --exclude-label surface claiming uses, so the poison threshold is
# enforced at SELECTION time rather than after a wasted claim.

# three were the work failing. The label is `sp-attempt-2-unlanded`, not `sp-attempt-2`: a
# bare number records that something happened without recording what, so a poison nobody can
# audit takes a bead out of circulation for reasons that have already scrolled away. The

# WHAT ENDED THIS SESSION — AND THE DEFAULT IS "WE DO NOT KNOW".
#
# The poison threshold means "we know this work keeps failing", so only an outcome that
# names what the WORK did wrong may charge against it. Everything else — an exit the harness
# cannot classify included — is evidence about the worker or about nothing at all. It used
# to be default-ALLOW, charging anything a small list of exemptions did not positively
# excuse, and every failure mode that cost the most was unenumerated when it fired: one bead
# poisoned on a lease reclaim, a red CI run and a claim, with a single rate-limit line in its
# log, and exempting the rate-limit case alone would not have saved it.
#
# The two directions are not symmetric, which is why the default goes this way. Default-deny
# fails by retrying a genuinely bad bead more often than necessary, and that costs passes.
# Default-allow fails by the queue destroying itself during an outage, and that costs the
# work — permanently, since poison is state a transient condition has no business writing.
#
#   unlanded  the session ran to its own end and the bead is not closed. A verdict about the
#             WORK exists: an aeon looked at it and did not finish it. THIS IS THE ONLY
#             OUTCOME THAT CHARGES AN ATTEMPT.
#   refused   the API turned the session away; it never acted. When a rate limit is reached
#             every summon dies in seconds with a rejection, burning lives off beads nobody
#             has looked at.
#   killed    it acted, then vanished without writing a terminal record — the host died, the
#             cgroup was torn down, or its worktree was deleted under it.
#   unknown   the trace cannot say. Charges nothing, on purpose.
#
# Deterministic and cheap (law-deterministic-before-inference): the presence of one tool call
# and of a terminal `result` record answers the whole question. The test is the TRACE and not
# the exit status — a session can exit non-zero having done real work, and a refused one exits
# the same way. `--output-format stream-json` emits an event per message and per tool call,
# so a segment carrying none of them is itself an answer: the session never got to speak.
#
# A MISSING FILE IS `unknown`, NOT `refused`. Zero has to be distinguishable from "we looked
# in the wrong place" or the check reads as all-clear when it is broken
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). Both decline to charge, so the recorded cause is the
# only thing that differs — which is exactly the point, because it is what a human reads when
# the counts stop making sense.
#
# Every branch is an `if`, never a bare `cmd && return`: an AND-list that fails is a failed
# command, and this is called from an EXIT trap, where one of those can end the shell

#   think_tok       of those, thinking
#   cost_usd        total_cost_usd, four decimals
#
# WHY IT IS KEPT AT ALL. Every one of these is already computed by the client and written to
# the terminal `result` record of every session, and nothing kept any of it — so the first
# time anyone asked where an aeon's hours went it took a purpose-built script over tens of
# megabytes of traces to answer, once, by hand. On the ledger line it is an awk one-liner
# over one small file, and cost per landed bead becomes a number a panel can read.
#
# ALL `result` RECORDS OF THE LAST ATTEMPT, through attempt_trace and never the raw file.
# The trace is appended to across attempts, so a session that was refused before it could
# speak would otherwise be billed the previous attempt's tokens — the same boundary error
# that charges a refusal as a verdict about the work, arriving as a cost figure instead of a
# poison count. Several `result` records in one segment is not a malformed trace: a session
# woken by a task notification emits a second record for the notification turn only, so the
# last record alone would mix scopes — its per-turn metrics describe the wake-up while its
# total_cost_usd is the session cumulative. Per-turn fields are SUMMED across all records
# so the session total is reported. Cumulative fields (duration_api_ms, total_cost_usd) are
# taken from the last record, where the client has fully accumulated them.
#
# EVERY FIELD IS INDEPENDENTLY `?`, AND NEVER 0. A record with no `duration_ms` has been
# observed in the wild beside one carrying it, so "the trace had no result at all" and "this
# client did not report that figure" have to be distinguishable from "the session spent
# nothing" — a refused session really did cost nearly nothing, and averaging the unreadable
# in with it is how a cost-per-bead figure comes out reassuring exactly when the harness is
# failing (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).

# and the next pass asked again. One bead reached the operator three times in forty minutes
# about work that had already landed, and he had to say so twice.
#
# So suppression keys on something the remedy does NOT move: the attempt count that produced
# the ask. At most one ask per (bead, count), ever. Clearing the poison still allows the retry
# it exists to allow — and only a genuinely new failure at count+1 may ask again. Same shape
# as watchd's backlog fingerprint, and for the same reason.

# ONE SESSION LOG PER BEAD, APPENDED TO, WITH ONE SEGMENT PER ATTEMPT.
#
# aeon.sh used to open the log with `>`, so an attempt erased its predecessor and only the
# last one of a bead had a trace at all. On a day when a capacity outage killed 121 sessions
# in three to seven seconds each, three traces survived; every other one had been overwritten
# by the next attempt on the same bead, and with them the only record of why the session
# died. The operator, verbatim: "I don't want to miss any insights from here on."
#
# Appending rather than one file per attempt is deliberate. The heartbeat decides whether a
# session is alive by watching `stat -c %s` on this path grow, and that check reads a fixed
# name — a new filename per attempt leaves it watching a file nobody is writing, which is
# indistinguishable from a wedged session and costs the bead its lease. Appending keeps the
# growth signal exactly as it was.
#
# What appending DOES change is that the file now holds events from sessions that are over,
# so every reader that asks "what is happening" must read the LAST segment and not the whole
# file: a `result` record from attempt 1 taken for attempt 3's would pause the harness for a
# capacity outage that ended hours ago, or report a finished session's last tool call as a
# live one's. attempt_trace is that boundary, and it is the only place the mark is parsed.
#
# The mark is a constant rather than a configuration key because it is a FORMAT, not a path:
# an operator who changed it would make every log already on disk unreadable by the code that
# writes the next line of it. It is defined once here and written by aeon.sh through
# spira_trace_mark, so the writer and the readers cannot drift.
#
# It is not JSON and does not start with `{`, which is what makes it inert: every consumer of
# this trace already skips any line that is not a JSON object, so the mark passes through
# trace_last, trace_tail, capacity_reset_at and tokens.sh without special handling.

# attempt is only CHARGED when a session fails, and a session refused by the account is
# deliberately charged nothing — so the label count answers "how many failures were blamed on
# this work", which is a different question from "which session am I reading" and was off by
# every successful and every refused run. Here the file is its own authority.
#
# `kept=` IS THE METER, and it is here because nothing prunes these logs. Appending trades
# bounded disk for a complete history, and the quantity given away is exactly the bytes
# already retained for this bead — so it is recorded at the head of every attempt rather than
# left to be discovered when a volume fills (law-take-the-simple-fix-with-a-meter). A bead

# content_landed <repo> <branch> <baseref> -> 0 if <baseref> already contains every change
# <branch> makes, 1 if it does not.
#
# ANCESTRY IS NOT THE ONLY WAY WORK LANDS, AND ON A SQUASHING REPOSITORY IT IS NEVER THE WAY.
# A squash merge replays the branch's whole diff as ONE NEW COMMIT with a new SHA and a
# parentage the branch does not appear in, so the branch's own commits are not ancestors of
# the base and never will be. Every SHA-based test therefore answers "not landed" about work
# that is demonstrably on the base — and then the rebase that follows CONFLICTS, precisely
# because the base already holds those changes. The harness read that pair as a branch in
# trouble and reopened a finished bead with "does not rebase onto <base>", which was true and
# meant the opposite of what it was taken to mean. It repeats forever, because nothing about
# the situation changes between passes.
#
# So ask the question that actually matters: would merging this branch into the base change
# anything? `merge-tree --write-tree` performs the three-way merge in memory and prints the
# resulting tree; when that tree IS the base's own tree, the merge is a no-op and the content
# is already there. This is deliberately not the rebase's question — a rebase replays commit
# by commit and can conflict on an intermediate patch whose end state is fine, which is
# exactly the false alarm.
#
# It answers NO when the merge conflicts (non-zero exit) and NO when the merged tree differs,
# both of which mean the branch really does carry something the base lacks. That is what makes
# it safe for a caller that DELETES on the answer: it cannot say "landed" about a branch with
# work outstanding. `landed()` above is a different question — whether a commit on the base
# names the BEAD — and is not a substitute here, because a branch may carry commits beyond the
# one that landed.

# detect_livelocked -> one LIVELOCK line per open bead that cannot make progress.
#
# THE PROBLEM. A bead is livelocked when it is open but will never advance unless a human
# intervenes — not merely "blocked" by an open dependency (correct sequencing), but stuck
# for a structural reason the harness cannot resolve on its own. "Nothing ready" and "beads
# ready but stuck" look identical to the sentinel; this check names each bead and why.
#
# FOUR CATEGORIES, each found by a different predicate:
#
#   unclaimable          no persona can claim it: fayth: preference does not match the
#                        partition, or the bead carries no partition label at all. The
#                        sentinel reports every queue empty, truthfully; this names which
#                        beads are responsible. (Reuses detect_unclaimable_ready logic.)
#
#   needs-ryan-no-overseer  carries needs-ryan (excluded from every fayth predicate) but
#                        lacks overseer (the label the decisions pane selects on). The bead
#                        is invisible to both the loop and to Ryan — it cannot be answered
#                        and cannot be dispatched.
#
#   ci-stuck             carries awaiting-ci (excluded from every fayth predicate, and from
#                        the stranded-work report) but the repository's land mode is not `pr`,
#                        so no run will ever report back. The label is a permanent hold that
#                        no mechanism will ever clear.
#
#   unmapped-repo        carries repo:<name> where <name> is not in the repo-map. aeon.sh
#                        refuses to claim it at claim time and leaves it open forever.
#
# SKIPS beads that are merely BLOCKED (open dependency), since those are correct
# sequencing — bd ready does not surface them and they need no action.
#
# OUTPUT: "LIVELOCK <id> <category> — <reason>"
# Each category uses its own slug so the rendering can group or colour by kind.
#
# A FAILED QUERY RETURNS NOTHING AND EXITS 0 (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control is
# handled by the caller: livelock_keys emits SP_LIVELOCKED=? when this returns nothing).

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE REPOSITORY REGISTRY. Which repository a bead is worked in comes from THE BEAD — a
# `repo:<name>` label, the same partition every imported Gas Town bead already carries —
# and `repo-map` says what that name means on this disk.
#
# It used to come from the fayth, as FAYTH_REPO, which is a constant per persona: every
# fayth in the chamber pointed at the home checkout, so Spira could not touch any other
# repository on the box. Collapsing the per-repository databases into one made the cross-repo
# DEPENDENCY expressible and left the cross-repo WORK impossible, which is most of what the
# collapse was for. It surfaced the day the operator endorsed fixing ~37 grep -q
# pipelines in another repository and there was no aeon that could open the file.
#
# UNKNOWN NAMES FAIL CLOSED. Every lookup here returns non-zero for a name the map does not
# carry, and every caller must treat that as a refusal rather than reach for a default. A
# default of the home checkout is precisely how another repository's bead gets "fixed" in the
# home repo, and the aeon would report success — it committed, on a branch, naming its bead.
# `repo:town` is deliberately unmapped for the same reason it is deliberately unfenced: Gas
# Town is still serving and new dispatch into it is frozen.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# clean clone has a map at all. This line is the guard for a lib.sh sourced without it.

# can still push to github.com. What is contained is REACH, not location.
#
# Prod is entirely unaffected: the check is a no-op when SPIRA_INSTANCE is absent or
# 'prod'. The map is read exactly once, at the moment lib.sh is sourced, so the
# harness refuses before it does any work rather than at first use.
#

# THE CI PARK, AND THE TWO WAYS IT BECOMES A LIE.
#
# An aeon parks a bead on `$SPIRA_CI_LABEL` once its pull request is open, so nothing pays an
# Opus session to sit and watch a test suite. The label is excluded from every fayth's
# predicate AND from the stalled-work report, which is what stops parked work looking
# abandoned — and is exactly what makes a park applied where no run exists permanent and
# invisible: not claimable, not reported, and displayed as "in CI", the one description that
# stops anybody looking for the real cause. A bead reached 22 reclaims that way, not one of
# them a work failure.
#
#   no-ci    the repository does not land through pull requests, so there is no run and never
#            will be one. Only `pr` mode opens one: `push` merges the branch itself and `hold`
#            leaves it for a human, and for both of those the landing gate IS the gate, so
#            once it passes there is nothing further to wait for. An UNMAPPED repository
#            answers here too, and should — a repository the map cannot resolve cannot land
#            at all, so a park on it is waiting for something that has no mechanism.
#            This is also the case a check made at the moment of parking could not catch: a
#            bead that MOVED repository while parked was parked correctly and is not now.
#   expired  whatever the repository, a park older than the longest plausible run is not
#            parked, it is lost. Expiring it hands the bead back to the report that would
#            have found it (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#   watch    a pull-request repository, inside the deadline. Leave it alone.
#
# RC 2 MEANS THE PARK COULD NOT BE AGED — a missing or unparseable timestamp. It prints
# `watch` with it, because the two callers want different things from that and neither wants
# a guess: the sweep must not strip a label on the strength of a clock it could not read,
# while the pane must not paint an unreadable check as normal. A broken check that renders as
# all-clear displaces the suspicion that would have prompted a look.
#
# Pure decision — no database, no network, no writes — so the sweep and the pane share one
# answer instead of two that can disagree, and a suite can drive every branch of it.

# THE BASE. Every branch this harness creates, and every branch it lands, is measured
# against the REMOTE-TRACKING ref of its repository's default branch — never the local one.
#
# Nothing in the harness ever advances the shared checkout's default branch. The sentinel
# lands by pushing `landing:<branch>` to the remote from the .landing worktree and never
# pulls the shared checkout, so the local ref there is however stale the last human left it. Every
# Spira bead edits the same handful of files under .claude/spira, and the queue is
# serialised at one aeon, so a branch cut from that stale ref collides with whatever landed
# while the previous aeon worked — by construction, every single time. Measured:
# sp-poison-retry based at 8ed6cca with main already at 5da8438, conflicting in sentinel.sh,
# lib.sh, gate.sh and log.md, none of which it had touched.
#
# THE DEFAULT BRANCH IS NOT `main`, AND ASSUMING IT IS BREAKS THREE THINGS AT ONCE. Measured
# across seven rows of a real repo-map: two had no ref named `main` anywhere, remote or local
# — their default is `master` — and a third had no remote named `origin` at all. For those
# three the old answer named a branch
# that does not exist, so `git worktree add -b spira/<id> "$WORK" "$BASE"` failed and no aeon
# could get a workspace in them at all; CHECK 6's rebase failed and REOPENED finished work
# with "does not rebase onto main"; and `gh pr create --base main` opened against nothing.
#
# So the answer is RESOLVED per repository, in this order, and a repository whose answer
# cannot be established is refused rather than guessed — the same way an unmapped `repo:`
# name is refused. `main` is a guess, and a guess here rebases somebody's work onto a branch
# nobody chose.
#
#   1. repo-map's `base` column. Declared beats derived: the two automatic sources below are
#      both local caches that can be stale, absent, or pointing at whatever branch a human
#      last checked out.
#   2. refs/remotes/origin/HEAD — what the remote said its default was, cached at clone time.
#   3. `git remote set-head <remote> --auto`, which ASKS the remote and caches the answer in
#      exactly the ref rung 2 reads, so it costs one round trip ever rather than one a pass.
#      Only reached when the map is silent and the cache is empty.
#   4. a repository with NO remote at all: its own current branch. Nothing can be stale
#      against a remote that does not exist, so HEAD is the only truth there is. This is the
#      test fixture's case.
#
# THE CHECKOUT'S CURRENT BRANCH IS NEVER CONSULTED FOR A REPOSITORY THAT HAS A REMOTE, and
# that restriction is load-bearing rather than fastidious: measured the same day, two of them
# sat on a DETACHED HEAD, one on a topic branch and another on
# `chore/keep-cf-access-probe`. Deriving the land ref from HEAD would have answered
# the remote form of that topic branch — a worse answer than the bug it replaced,
# because it names a ref that exists.

# ======================================================================================
# DESTRUCTION. Every removal of a bead's worktree or branch goes through this section, and
# nothing outside it may call `git worktree remove`, `git branch -D` or `rm -rf` on a tree.
#
# WHY IT IS ONE SITE. A bead's worktree and branch were both destroyed while its aeon was
# mid-edit and its lease was live, taking forty minutes of uncommitted work, writing no
# salvage, and NAMING THE BEAD IN NO LOG — the Sending's own passes bracket the deletion and
# report the tree HELD on one side and 0 reaped on the other, so the actor was some other
# process entirely. It had happened twenty times to the same bead, every note reading
# "Reclaimed by strand.sh", which is the signature an aeon leaves when its workspace vanishes
# underneath it: twenty aeons spent re-deriving work the harness then ate.
#
# The lesson is not "fix that caller". Deletion was SPREAD ACROSS SIX SITES, each with its own
# guard or none, reachable by anything that sources this file with the default environment —
# including a test suite run from the installed tree, which is how an operator's real
# checkouts were once swept (see test-sending.sh's own header). A rule enforced at six sites
# is a rule enforced at whichever of them the next caller does not use. So the rule lives at
# one site, it is unconditional, and it does not care who is calling.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES, and why each is not optional:
#
#   • A path outside `$SPIRA_RUN/worktree/`. A deleter handed anything else has been
#     misconfigured — a fixture that forgot to set SPIRA_RUN, a repo-map naming a real

#   • TWO liveness witnesses, not one. `holder_alive` reads a pidfile that is absent for the
#     seconds between `bd ready --claim` and the aeon writing it; the bead's status is stale
#     for as long as it takes a killed aeon's lease to be reclaimed. Either alone has a blind
#     spot the other covers, so BOTH must say nobody is home.
#   • A status witness that could not be examined at all. An unreachable database answers
#     "not in_progress" exactly as a genuinely open bead does, and the wrong one of those
#     reads as permission (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). The probe is proved able to

# EVENTS — what the harness DID, in a form that survives the next repaint.
#
# Outcomes used to exist only as text. The health pane's RECENT line scraped three log files
# for landings, reopenings, poisonings, reclaims and claims and then `sort -r | head -4`, so
# everything below the fourth line was not aged out — it was never stored. "How many times
# did a bead reopen" was unanswerable without grepping a log that rotates.
#
# An event is a CLOSED `event` bead written through `$SPIRA_NOTIFY`, which is the one place
# that knows the shape: no labels at all, because an OPEN bead carrying `spira,plan` is
# claimable by an aeon and one carrying `overseer` lands in the queue of things awaiting the
# operator; `--kind` for the badge the panel renders; and `--target` for the bead the outcome
# happened TO, in its own column, so the stream filters per bead rather than per substring.
# That column comes back from `bd --json` as `target` — only `event_kind` keeps the prefix
# its flag carries, so a reader spelling it `event_target` gets null from a row that is
# populated and reads it as an emitter that never set it.
#
# THE RATE LIMIT IS PART OF THE EMITTER, NOT A LATER FIX. These fire on a two-minute timer
# and a reclaim storm is real. One event per attempt would bury every pilgrimage.complete in
# the same view, and a stream nobody can read is the log line it replaced. So a (kind, target)
# pair emits at most once per SPIRA_EVENT_COOLDOWN; repeats inside the window are COUNTED,
# not written, and the count rides out on the next event — "+26 more since 09:14Z" is the
# fact worth having about a retry loop, and one row is how it stays readable. A hot loop is
# a steady state, and a steady state is not news.
#
# SUPPRESSED IS NOT DROPPED, and that distinction is the reason the count is carried rather
# than the window simply being silent: a panel that renders a storm as one quiet row is a
# check reporting all-clear on the thing it exists to show.
#
# PER-KEY FILES, NOT ONE TABLE. aeon.sh, landing.sh and strand.sh emit from separate
# processes at the same time, and a read-modify-write of a shared table loses the OTHER
# pairs' counts under a race. One file per pair races only with itself, and the worst
# outcome of that race is one duplicate row.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Not in SPIRA_CONF_KEYS deliberately, alongside SPIRA_GHOST_GRACE and SPIRA_STRAND_GRACE

#
# A REBASE PRODUCES A TREE NOBODY FORMATTED. git replays hunks; it does not re-run anyone's
# formatter on the result, so a rebase that resolves perfectly still hands the required
# check a tree that no human or tool ever laid out. It recurs on exactly the shape a rebase
# is best at — two branches adding names to the same import list, struct literal or match
# arm — where each side is individually well-formed and the union is over the line limit.
# The branch then fails `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, a check it passed before the harness
# touched it, and the failure is charged to the aeon that wrote correct code.
#
# ONLY WHAT THE BRANCH TOUCHED IS COMMITTED. The declared command is repository-wide, because
# that is the writing form of the repository-wide check it must satisfy — but a repository
# whose main is already unformatted would otherwise have its entire tree swept into one
# bead's branch. Against a clean main this restriction changes nothing, since a rebase can
# only disturb the layout of files the branch itself touched; against a dirty one it is the
# difference between a format commit and a rewrite.
#
# A FORMATTER THAT FAILS CHANGES NOTHING. `cargo fmt` exits non-zero on a tree it cannot
# parse, and it may have rewritten half of it first. Discard and let the gate render the
# verdict — a formatter is a convenience, and it must never be able to turn a clean rebase

# rebase_branch <branch> <onto> [repo] [repo-name] -> 0 if <branch> now contains <onto>, 1
# if it does not. On failure the branch ref is left EXACTLY as it was and $REBASE_CONFLICTS
# names the paths that collided. On success, and only when commits were actually replayed,
# the repository's own formatter runs on the result and is committed as part of the rebase —
# see format_rebased. The branch tip therefore MOVES on success, and a caller holding a tip
# from before the call is holding a stale one.
#
# THE CALLER MUST HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT NO LIVE AEON HOLDS THE BRANCH. This rewrites
# commits beneath a working tree; doing that under a running aeon destroys work in flight,
# which is the one failure here that is not recoverable. `holder_alive` is the precondition.
#
# WHY THE BRANCH'S OWN WORKTREE. git refuses to move a ref that a worktree has checked out
# — `git branch -f` and `git rebase` both — so when a worktree holds the branch it is the
# only place the rebase can happen. When nothing holds it the rebase still needs SOME
# working tree, and that tree must never be the shared checkout, whose HEAD an interactive
# session is using; a detached scratch worktree costs one checkout.
#
# A rebase is refused by tracked modifications, and those are routine rather than
# exceptional here: wiki/tasks.md is a GENERATED file tracked in git and rewritten by a
# timer, so it is dirty in every worktree within minutes of its creation and would
# otherwise block every rebase for a reason that has nothing to do with the work. Tracked
# changes are salvaged to a patch and discarded; untracked files are left alone, because
# `git diff HEAD` cannot carry their content and discarding them would destroy the one copy.
#
# A FAILURE IS NAMED, BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THEM IS THE BRANCH'S FAULT. Every way this can
# return 1 used to look the same to a caller — one exit status and an empty $REBASE_CONFLICTS
# — so a caller that reopens a bead on a rebase failure reopened it for a missing ref, an
# unresolvable base and a scratch tree it could not build, all with the words "conflicts in
# unknown". That is a lie about a bead and it costs a session:
#
#   21:51:17  landed spira/<id>            <- pass A lands it
#   21:52:13  landing: starting a pass     <- pass B reads the branch list, <id> still in it
#   21:52:36  REMOVED branch spira/<id>    <- the Sending reaps it
#   22:00:55  reopened <id> — does not rebase onto origin/main; conflicts in unknown
#
# Pass B held an eight-minute-old list, reached a ref that was gone, and this function said
# "1" about it. $REBASE_FAILURE now says which:
#
#   conflict      the rebase RAN and the commits disagree — the branch's own fault, and the
#                 only value on which finished work may be put back on the board
#   no-branch     the ref is gone: reaped, landed, or slain under a stale list
#   no-base       the ref it lands on does not resolve
#   no-worktree   no tree to replay in
#
# The last three are the pass failing to ask the question, never an answer to it.
