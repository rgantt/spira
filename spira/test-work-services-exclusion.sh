# test-work-services-exclusion.sh — world.sh work_services() excludes the
# instance-qualified cockpit and Loom service names, not only their bare
# pre-migration forms.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, each with its positive control (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. POSITIVE CONTROL: the old exclusion pattern (^spira-cockpit\.service$) does NOT
#      match spira-cockpit-prod.service — proving the defect and proving the new assertion
#      cannot be met by the old code. An assertion that passes both old and new code is not
#      evidence of the fix (sp-4biz survived exactly that kind of check).
#
#   2. work_services() — called by world.sh stop — excludes both cockpit and Loom when
#      their names carry the instance suffix. Work units (sentinel, landing) are preserved.
#
#   3. world.sh stop does not pass cockpit or Loom to systemctl stop. The pair survives a
#      stop/start cycle, which is the operator-visible property the comment in world.sh
#      promises.
#
# SYSTEMCTL IS STUBBED — no real units are touched.
#
# defect: sp-xfg4
# covers: spira/world.sh spira/conf.sh

# 1. POSITIVE CONTROL: old exclusion pattern lets instance-qualified names through.
#
# The grep pattern that existed before this fix only excluded the bare name
# (^spira-cockpit\.service$). Feed the same unit list the stub returns and show
# that the old pattern includes cockpit-prod and loom-prod in its output — the bug.
# This proves the assertions in section 2 and 3 cannot be met by the old code.
