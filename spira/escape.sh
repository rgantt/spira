# escape.sh — direct-summon an aeon for a named fayth, bypassing pool and lane checks.
#
#   escape.sh <fayth>           summon one aeon for <fayth>
#   escape.sh <fayth> --dry-run show what would be claimed, claim nothing
#
# WHEN TO USE. The sentinel decides how many aeons may start by comparing live aeon counts
# against pool and lane budgets. A bug in that arithmetic — wrong pool calculation, a lane
# accidentally counted against the pool — can prevent the bead that REPAIRS the bug from
# being claimed: the scheduler cannot schedule its own fix. This script is the path around
# that. It skips the pool and lane capacity checks entirely and invokes the aeon directly.
#
# THE CONTROL PLANE MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE DATA PLANE IT CONTROLS. Normal scheduling is
# the data plane; a broken scheduler is exactly when this — the control plane — must be
# reachable. Ryan's own case: eight P0s skipped because the bug fixing the ordering logic
# was itself subject to the ordering it would fix.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT BYPASS. The fayth must exist. Its partition must have ready work.
# The account must have API capacity. The bead must not be poisoned. The fayth's own
# FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT is enforced by aeon.sh internally. All of that still applies.
#
# WHEN NOT TO USE. Normal scheduling is observable, coordinated, and lower-cost. Reserve
# this for a scheduler that is demonstrably failing to summon a fayth that has ready work.
