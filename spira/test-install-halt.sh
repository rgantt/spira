# test-install-halt.sh — install.sh respects world.halted and does not restart a
# deliberately stopped Spira as a side effect of shipping a new unit.
#
#   ./test-install-halt.sh
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST
# -----------------------
# A halted world has $SPIRA_RUN/world.halted on disk. install.sh must install and
# enable units but must NOT start them. A running world must still get enable --now
# so the guard cannot degrade into "never start anything" (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# THE FIXTURE USES A MOCK systemctl THAT RECORDS CALLS WITHOUT TOUCHING SYSTEMD.
# Assertions read the log to check which flags were used. A mock that exits 0 for
# every verb is permissive by design: we are testing the CALLER'S logic, not systemd's.
# Pin a non-default SPIRA_RUN so the halt stamp resolves there, not to the operator's
# live run directory (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
#
# covers: systemd/install.sh
