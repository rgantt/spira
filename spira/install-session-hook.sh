# install-session-hook.sh — register the session hook in the coding agent's own settings file.
#
#   install-session-hook.sh install            add or refresh Spira's entries
#   install-session-hook.sh status             what is registered on the session events
#   install-session-hook.sh uninstall          remove Spira's entries
#   install-session-hook.sh prune <substring>  remove every entry whose command contains it
#
# WHAT IT WIRES, AND WHY THOSE TWO EVENTS
# ---------------------------------------
# `SessionStart` with NO MATCHER, and `PostCompact` with no matcher.
#
# A matcher is a regular expression tested against the event's match query, and an absent or
# `*` matcher matches everything. For `SessionStart` the match query is its `source`, which
# the client's own hook-input schema restricts to `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` and
# `fork`. Naming a subset of those is how a hook comes to be missing from exactly the case it
# was written for: a three-way `clear|startup|resume` — a shape that is easy to arrive at —
# silently omits `compact` and `fork`, both of which open a context window with no Monitor
# attached, which is the only condition this hook is about. An absent matcher also survives
# the client adding a sixth source, where a list would go quietly missing on it.
#
# `PostCompact` is registered as well because compaction does NOT reach the hook through
# `SessionStart` in every client build: the compaction routine raises `PreCompact` before and
# `PostCompact` after, and `PostCompact`'s results are appended to the rebuilt context. Its
# match query is the trigger, `manual` or `auto`, and an automatic compaction is precisely the
# one nobody is present for. Registering both is what makes the claim "a context reset
# re-latches" true rather than true-on-the-paths-somebody-tested.
#
# `SessionEnd` is NOT registered. Under systemd there are no processes for a departing session
# to guarantee, and its output goes into a context that is being discarded. The hook handles
# the event so that registering it costs nothing, but a hook whose only effect is a process
# spawn is noise with a cost.
#
# WHY A PROGRAM AND NOT AN INSTRUCTION
# ------------------------------------
# This file belongs to a program the harness does not ship, it lives outside every checkout,
# and nothing that lands in this repository can change it. A registration done by hand is done
# once and then rots invisibly — the failure being fixed here is a hook still bound to a path
# whose harness had been decommissioned, printing its banner into every session on the box.
# `status` is the check, and `doctor.sh` runs it.
#
# IT MANAGES ITS OWN ENTRIES AND NOBODY ELSE'S. `install` replaces Spira's and reports any
# other command registered on the same events rather than removing it — deleting somebody
# else's hook is not a decision this may take silently. `prune` is how that removal is asked
# for, by name, one substring at a time.
