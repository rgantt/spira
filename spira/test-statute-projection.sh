# test-statute-projection.sh — statute projection integrity: rule.sh and law-synth.sh
#   guard against silent synthesis failures and wrong-database overwrites.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST
# ------------------
# Three defects discovered 2026-09-11 (sp-p0xyt):
#
#   1. rule.sh called synth() and discarded its exit code, printing "Statute is live" even
#      when synthesis had failed. A missing or non-executable hook returned 0 silently.
#
#   2. law-synth.sh guarded the database path but not its content: a store with .beads and
#      zero law- memories passed the check and overwrote 112 statutes with 3.
#
#   3. law-cron.sh's detection was correct but wrote to a log file nobody reads. The fix is
#      SP_STATUTE_SKEW in cockpit.env (cockpit.sh statute_keys), surfaced where the operator
#      actually sees it.
#
# PAIRS (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control): every negative case is paired with a positive
# case so silence from the negative case looks like failure, not peace.
#
# REAL DB (law-prefer-the-real-dependency): tests run against a real bd fixture database via
# testdb.sh, not a stub that models only the surface we remember.
#
# covers: rule.sh spira/cockpit.sh
