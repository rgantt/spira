# test-cockpit-unclaimable.sh — SP_NEXT shows the persona that WILL claim a bead,
#                               not the one the partition query found it under.
#
# THE DEFECT. sp-f8vry: a bead carrying fayth:ops on spira,plan labels appears in
# builder's partition query (because builder's labels are a subset of its labels). Before
# this fix the aggregator stamped it as "_partition=builder" and emitted
# "SP_NEXT0=P1 builder sp-foo ..." — telling the operator builder would claim it.
# Builder cannot claim it (fayth:ops excludes builder); ops cannot claim it (no incident
# label). The bead is unclaimable, but the panel said "builder" for fifteen hours.
#
# THE FIX. The aggregator now receives the partition map (label-set → persona name) and
# checks each bead's fayth: preference at render time. If a preference is present and the
# named persona's labels are not all on the bead, the partition label becomes "unclaimable"
# rather than the persona that won the label query but cannot actually claim the work.
