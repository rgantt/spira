# test-suites-timer.sh — spira-suites.timer exists, fires periodically, and invokes
# suites.sh run via spira-suites.service.
#
#   ./test-suites-timer.sh
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS. The defect (sp-mfa4) was that nothing invoked suites.sh run: the timed
# suite set existed in code but had no timer, so every "run by the timed runner" claim was
# fiction. The failure mode is perfectly silent: suites.sh status reports "never ran" as "?"
# for every result, which reads as healthy until someone notices that ? never changes.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, each with its positive control:
#
#   1. THE SERVICE INVOKES suites.sh run — the exact subcommand, not just the script. A
#      service that calls suites.sh with no argument calls `list`, not `run`, and produces
#      beautiful output while running nothing.
#
#   2. THE TIMER FIRES PERIODICALLY — OnUnitActiveSec is present. A timer with only
#      OnBootSec fires once after boot and then never again, which is indistinguishable from
#      a missing timer after the first pass.
#
#   3. THE TIMER IS IN THE INSTALL ENABLE LIST — install.sh enables it. A unit that is
#      installed but not enabled is, again, a timer that never fires. The list is read from
#      install.sh's source rather than from the running system so this check survives a clean
#      clone or a CI run with no systemd.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL IS FIRST IN EVERY CASE (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control). A parser
# that returns "" on any input passes an "is it in the list" assertion just as well, because
# the assertion is on absence (the thing would not be absent). So each property proves the
# extractor can find a KNOWN entry before trusting a verdict of "present".
#
# THE CHECK IS AGAINST THE TEMPLATE FILES, not the running system. Templates are the source;
# the rendered, installed units derive from them. A test that requires an active systemd
# session passes nowhere the harness runs unattended.
#
# defect: sp-mfa4
