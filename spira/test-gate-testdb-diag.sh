# test-gate-testdb-diag.sh — gate-spira.sh preserves the testdb_up diagnostic
# when a suite's fixture build fails.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS. When a suite calls testdb_up and it returns
# non-zero (e.g. "fixture lock", "bd init failed"), gate-spira.sh's run()
# must pass the diagnostic through to its own output. A prior version of
# gate-spira.sh suppressed testdb_up's stderr with `>/dev/null 2>&1`, leaving
# the operator to read "see testdb_up's output above" with nothing above it
# (sp-iap9). The fix is the `setsid bash "$s" > "$tmp" 2>&1` capture in run(),
# which collects both streams; this suite proves that capture is live.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
# Case 1 proves the stub testdb_up actually emits the token before asserting
# gate-spira.sh captures it — a silent or broken stub would produce a false
# all-clear on Case 2.
