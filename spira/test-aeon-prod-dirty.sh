#   ./test-aeon-prod-dirty.sh
#
# THE DEFECT THIS GUARDS. An aeon that closes a bead while its own worktree carries
# uncommitted tracked modifications has left unreviewed code invisible to the commit graph.
# The guard must be bound to $WORK (the aeon's own worktree) — not to $SPIRA_REPO (the
# shared harness checkout). Binding it to the shared checkout punishes whichever aeon
# happens to close next for a condition it neither caused nor can fix, producing an
# unbounded requeue loop whenever any stray file appears in the shared checkout.
#
# FOUR CASES (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   1. Bead closed, OWN WORKTREE dirty (staged change) → reopened, paths named, override named.
#   2. Bead closed, SPIRA_REPO dirty, own worktree clean → bead stays closed (the fixed bug).
#   3. Bead closed, own worktree clean, SPIRA_REPO clean → bead stays closed (baseline).
#   4. Bead closed, own worktree dirty, SPIRA_ALLOW_PROD_DIRTY=1 → bead stays closed (override).
#
# Case 2 is the regression test for sp-nqtrg: before the fix, a stray staged file in
# SPIRA_REPO would requeue every bead in the pipeline. After the fix it is a box condition
# that skew.sh reports separately, and the queue drains normally.
#
# Case 1 also verifies that a refused close leaves the work commit intact on the branch —
# a retry is a retry, not a rebuild.
#
# Driven through the REAL aeon.sh against a real bd on a throwaway fixture, with a shim
# standing in for the model (law-prefer-the-real-dependency). SPIRA_REPO is a separate git
# repository from the bead's target repo, matching production topology where the harness
# checkout and the work repo are different paths.
#
# ISOLATION BETWEEN CASES: after each case where the bead is reopened, the bead is marked
# spira-poison so subsequent aeon runs do not claim it. Only the current case's bead is
# available for the next aeon.

# this suite without affecting the caller's environment (subshell cannot modify parent).
#
# SPIRA_DB IS ALSO UNSET. The aeon session sets SPIRA_DB to the production database path,

# `bd migrate schema` against any SPIRA_DB that has .beads. The production database uses
# a dolt server that may not be running during a test. Unsetting SPIRA_DB causes conf.sh
# to re-derive it to the default path (~/.local/share/spira/db) which has no .beads, so
# the migration check is skipped. testdb_up then sets SPIRA_DB to the fresh fixture.
