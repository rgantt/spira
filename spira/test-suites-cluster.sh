# test-suites-cluster.sh — same-cause reds file one bead, not one per suite.
#
#   ./test-suites-cluster.sh
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST. When multiple suites in a timed pass fail on the same
# normalised first FAIL line, suites.sh must cluster them and file ONE bead naming
# every member suite — not one bead per suite. Suites that fail DIFFERENTLY must
# each receive their own bead.
#
# THE EVIDENCE THAT MOTIVATED THIS. On 2026-09-12, ten of fourteen test-X.sh-is-red
# beads came from three causes. Two of those three were shared-cause events:
#   - five beads from one fixture-level fault (fixed by file_fixture_fault already)
#   - two beads (sp-mwf, sp-w54) from one gate-spira.sh CWD issue
# Each shared-cause group should have filed one bead. Instead it filed one per suite.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   - Three suites with the SAME first FAIL line must produce one cluster bead.
#   - Three suites with DISTINCT FAIL lines must each produce their own bead.
#   - Total beads: 4 (not 6).
#
# SUPPRESSION COUNT (law-dedup-must-be-measured):
#   - The pass output reports how many beads the clustering suppressed.
#
# RECURRENCE STABILITY: the cause-cluster ref is stable across passes so repeated
# occurrences bump recurrence, not a fresh bead.
