# test-canary.sh — exercises stage.sh (the isolated test environment builder) and
# canary.sh (the end-to-end pipeline canary that runs on that stage).
#
#   ./test-canary.sh
#
# WHAT THIS TESTS:
#   - stage.sh up creates a fully isolated Spira environment under a temp dir
#   - Every path exported by up resolves under STAGE_ROOT (isolation assertion)
#   - The stage's beads database is usable (bd create/list round-trips)
#   - The stage git setup is correct: bare remote + working checkout on main
#   - stage.sh down removes STAGE_ROOT completely
#   - canary.sh runs end-to-end on a stage: bead filed → sentinel pass (with
#     fake-summon.sh / canary-worker.sh) → landing pass → commit on origin/main
#
# POSITIVE CONTROLS:
#   - Bead-visible-in-stage-db proves the DB check is asking the right store
#   - Commit-absent-before-canary proves the canary check would have caught a miss
#
# ISOLATION GUARANTEE:
#   - Each test that mutates env runs in a subshell; stage vars cannot leak
#   - The real SPIRA_DB (before stage eval) is never written to in any test
#
# covers: spira/canary.sh spira/stage.sh
