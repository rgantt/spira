# groom-trigger.sh — file a trigger bead for the groomer persona.
#
# The groomer persona is a lane fayth: it draws from its own FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT
# slot and is woken by trigger beads carrying SPIRA_GROOMER_LABEL. This script
# files one such bead on a cadence (driven by spira-groom.timer), deduplicating
# so at most one open trigger exists at a time.
#
# DEDUP. An open trigger bead means a groom pass is either waiting to be claimed
# or actively running. Filing a second one while the first is still open would
# queue a redundant pass; the groomer's FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT=1 makes such a queue
# permanent — a lane with one slot and two trigger beads means the second trigger
# waits forever after the first, building an ever-growing backlog of noop passes.
# One open trigger is the correct steady state; this guard enforces it.
#
# SCOPE. The trigger bead carries SPIRA_SCOPE_LABEL + SPIRA_GROOMER_LABEL so the
# groomer's FAYTH_LABELS predicate selects it. One definition of the label keeps
# the fayth, the trigger, and the dedup query all consistent — changing the label
# in conf.sh changes all three.
#
# EXIT:
#   0  trigger bead filed, or an open trigger already exists (dedup) — either is
#      the correct outcome; the groomer will run when the sentinel next checks.
#   1  error filing the bead
