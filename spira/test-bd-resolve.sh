# test-bd-resolve.sh — conf.sh resolves SPIRA_BD deterministically and refuses a mismatch.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
# ----------------------
# When multiple bd binaries exist on PATH, the one each context picks depends on PATH order,
# which differs between a login shell, a systemd unit and an aeon's confined environment.
# SPIRA_BD is the pin: conf.sh sets it once, deterministically, so every child process
# inherits the same binary. And when the resolved bd's migration count disagrees with the
# database's, conf.sh refuses rather than letting the mismatch propagate silently to every
# bdq call.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL FIRST. Before asserting the pin works, plant two bd binaries on PATH and
# verify that with the wrong one first and no SPIRA_BD set, sourcing conf.sh fails — which
# is the schema refusal in action. That assertion is what would fail if the exit-on-mismatch
# block were removed (the bug shape of sp-s2zvn).
#
# WHAT IS VERIFIED
# 1. POSITIVE CONTROL: when SPIRA_BD resolves to a binary whose migration count disagrees
#    with the database, conf.sh exits non-zero (refuses).
# 2. conf.sh resolves SPIRA_BD to the first bd on its assembled PATH when neither the
#    environment nor the config file set it.
# 3. An env-set SPIRA_BD survives unchanged through conf.sh (env wins).
# 4. A config-file-set SPIRA_BD is respected (config wins over derived default).
# 5. When SPIRA_BD is set to the matching binary, conf.sh succeeds even with a fake db.
# 6. SPIRA_BD is exported so child processes inherit it.
