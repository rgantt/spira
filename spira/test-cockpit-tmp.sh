#
# write_snapshot builds the snapshot in a temp and renames it, so probing — the slow part,
# tens of seconds — happens with a file already on disk. A kill landing in that window used
# to leave the temp behind, and spira-cockpit.service is Restart=always: 303 of them
# accumulated in .runtime/spira, four of those partial writes rather than empty. The cost is
# not the bytes. A directory that grows a file per unclean exit hides how often unclean exits
# happen, because nothing counts them.
#
# EVERY CASE CARRIES ITS POSITIVE CONTROL. "No temp remains" is the same observation as "the
# check ran against the wrong directory", as "the process died before it ever made one", and
# as "the glob was empty all along" — so each case first asserts the temp IS there, mid-probe,
# before killing anything. A leak check that has never seen a temp is a hypothesis
# (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control).
#
# If the temp never appears the suite SKIPS with 77 rather than passing: probe needs `bd` and
# `git` to get far enough to be interrupted, and a box where it cannot start is a box where
# this property is unobservable, not one where it holds.
