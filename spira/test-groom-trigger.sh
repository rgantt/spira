# test-groom-trigger.sh — groom-trigger.sh: files the groomer's trigger bead and
# deduplicates when an open trigger already exists.
#
#   ./test-groom-trigger.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS GUARDING
# ---------------------------
# groom-trigger.sh is the missing scanner whose absence kept the groomer from ever
# running. The suite guards three properties:
#
#   1. When no trigger is open, it files a bead with SPIRA_SCOPE_LABEL and
#      SPIRA_GROOMER_LABEL (the groomer's FAYTH_LABELS partition).
#
#   2. When an open trigger already exists, it exits 0 WITHOUT filing another bead
#      (dedup). A second trigger would queue a redundant pass; with FAYTH_MAX_CONCURRENT=1
#      the second trigger would wait forever for the first, growing unboundedly.
#
#   3. The labels used are the same ones FAYTH_LABELS expands to, so the trigger
#      lands in exactly the partition the groomer queries. Tested by asserting both
#      SPIRA_SCOPE_LABEL and SPIRA_GROOMER_LABEL appear in the bd create call.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control)
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The dedup check requires a stub that returns a non-empty JSON array for bd list.
# The filing check requires a stub that returns '[]'. Both are tested explicitly so
# a stub bug cannot make dedup and filing look identical.
#
# STUB BD (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment)
# ----------------------------------------------
# groom-trigger.sh calls bd for list (dedup query) and create (filing). A real bd
# call requires a live Dolt server and a seeded database. The stub records argv to
# a log and returns configurable JSON for list and 0 for create. This proves
# groom-trigger.sh sends the right arguments to bd; bd's correctness is tested in
# suites that use testdb.sh.
