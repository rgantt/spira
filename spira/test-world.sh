# test-world.sh — world.sh stops work services and reports them honestly.

#   ./test-world.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE COVERS
# ----------------------
# 2026-09-07: world.sh stop printed STOPPED while spira-landing.service was still running.
# The check did not catch it because world.sh's own status reported timers and live aeons,
# and spira-landing is neither — it is a transient systemd unit that executes the same
# gate.sh passes an aeon does, supervised outside the timer loop.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, each a pair (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#
#   1. status reports spira-landing.service as active when it is, and inactive when it is not.
#      A status that always shows "inactive" and one that is merely correct look identical.
#
#   2. stop stops spira-landing.service (and any other active spira-*.service work unit),
#      confirmed by what the stub was asked to do.
#
#   3. stop exits non-zero and does NOT print STOPPED when a service cannot be stopped.
#      Without this, the scar is invisible: the operator halts, sees the success message,
#      and the worker goes on running.
#
#   4. live_workers (/proc) is non-zero when a process matching gate.sh or landing.sh is
#      running, and zero when it is not.
#
# systemctl IS STUBBED, not reached. A suite that asks the real systemd is green for as long
# as the box happens to be in the state its author had (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
# The stub records every call world.sh makes, so the assertions are about what world.sh DID,
# not about what systemd reported.
#
# defect: sp-i96t
# covers: spira/world.sh
# hermetic-ok: stubs systemctl via SPIRA_SYSTEMCTL; /proc scan uses real background process
