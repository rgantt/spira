# test-suites-result-files.sh — every suite in the timed run produces a .result file,
# regardless of whether it passed, failed, timed out, or was not reached in the budget.
#
#   ./test-suites-result-files.sh
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS (sp-04bd). Four timed suites produced no result files — they were
# unreached within the budget or their hangs wedged the runner before the fix. Without
# a result file, suites.sh status reports "?" for that suite, which is the same reading
# as "never ran", so the defect was invisible. The invariant: every suite in the timed
# population must have a .result file after every pass, regardless of outcome.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, each with its positive control:
#
#   1. A suite that runs and passes produces an "ok" result file.
#
#   2. A suite that hangs and is killed by the per-suite watchdog produces a "timeout"
#      result file. Without this, a hung suite leaves its slot empty and the status pane
#      reads "?" — indistinguishable from "never ran".
#
#   3. A suite not reached within the budget produces an "unreached" result file. This
#      is the specific shape sp-04bd observed: suites at the end of alphabetical order
#      ran out of budget and left no record at all.
#
# POSITIVE CONTROL (law-absence-needs-a-positive-control):
#   - Before the first run, no result files exist — proves the assertion is not vacuously
#     satisfied from a prior run.
#   - The ok and timeout results are verified before trusting the "unreached" verdict,
#     because a runner that produced no records at all would show every assertion as
#     "no result file", including the one meant to catch a different failure.
#
# BUDGET AND PERSUITE ARE PINNED SO THE UNREACHED CASE IS RELIABLE. With BUDGET=12 and
# PERSUITE=8, the hung suite consumes 8s of budget; the suite alphabetically after it
# finds left ≈ 4 ≤ 5 and goes to unreached. Even on a slow machine (2s per-step overhead),
# the margin leaves left ≤ 5 for the last suite.
#
# THE INTAKE IS THE REAL ONE on a throwaway database (law-prefer-the-real-dependency).
# EVERY CONFIGURED VALUE IS PINNED TO A NON-DEFAULT (law-gates-run-in-a-clean-environment).
