# units.sh — per-instance unit-naming library for the Spira harness.
#
# SOURCE THIS FILE; DO NOT EXECUTE IT. It is not a script with a main body —
# it is a library whose entire content is top-level initialisation. Executing
# it directly produces the same result as sourcing it into an empty shell, but
# sourcing is the intended contract: the functions and arrays it defines belong
# to the caller's shell.
#
# WHAT IT PROVIDES
# ----------------
#   inst_name <template-name>     — compute the per-instance installed unit name
#   inst_watch_name <watcher>     — compute the per-instance watcher unit name
#   UNITS                         — all unit template names (incl. optional conditionals)
#   ENABLE                        — unit names (per-instance) that should be enabled
#   OPTIONAL                      — template names excluded from UNITS by design
#   _watch_names                  — plain watcher names from the manifest (e.g. "testview")
#   watch_units                   — space-joined per-instance watcher unit names,
#                                   space-padded at both ends for membership tests
#
# WHAT CALLERS MUST SET BEFORE SOURCING
# --------------------------------------
#   SPIRA_INSTANCE     the instance suffix (e.g. "prod", "test")
#   SPIRA_HOME         the harness spira/ directory (provides watchd.sh)
#   SPIRA_DOLT_DATA    if non-empty, include and enable dolt-beads.service
#   SPIRA_TESTDB_DATA  if non-empty, include dolt-beads-test.service (not enabled)
#
# These are all set by conf.sh, so any caller that sources conf.sh first already
# has them. install.sh sources conf.sh before sourcing this file.
#
# GUARD AGAINST DOUBLE-SOURCING. A script that sources both this file and a
# helper that also sources it gets a second pass through the unit-list logic for
# free, which appends duplicate entries to UNITS and ENABLE. The guard prevents
# that: the second source call returns immediately.

# UNIT NAME MAPPING. Each spira-*.service/.timer gets a per-instance suffix appended before
# the extension so two instances can coexist on one machine without colliding unit names.
# Non-spira units (cockpit-ensure, concierge, beads-push, dolt-beads) are shared and keep
# their plain names. The watcher template (spira-watch@.service) is excluded here; its
# per-watcher per-instance names are built by inst_watch_name.
