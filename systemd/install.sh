# nobody reads and an ExecStart= that fails with a bare "No such file or directory" into a
# journal nobody is watching.
#
# NEVER EDIT AN INSTALLED UNIT. Edit the template and re-run this; `--diff` is how you find
# out that somebody did. The copies here are the source of truth, because
# ~/.config/systemd/user is one directory on one disk that nothing backs up.
#
# UNITS ARE CATTLE: unique plain names per instance — spira-sentinel-prod.service,
# spira-sentinel-test.service — no systemd templates, no %i, each unit carrying its
# instance written out in full. Units whose names start with 'spira-' get the instance
# suffix; units whose names do not (cockpit-ensure, concierge, beads-push, dolt-beads)
# are shared across instances and installed under their plain names. The watcher template
# (spira-watch@.service) is rendered once per manifest row, with %i substituted, and
# installed as spira-watch-<name>-<instance>.service — no systemd @-instantiation.
