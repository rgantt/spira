# concierge.sh — the single Remote Control session the operator talks to from their phone.
#
#   concierge.sh start     launch it in tmux for the phone (idempotent)
#   concierge.sh here      run it in the FOREGROUND, at this terminal; args pass to claude
#   concierge.sh attach    attach locally
#   concierge.sh brief     render the system prompt and print its path; change nothing
#   concierge.sh status    is it up
#   concierge.sh stop      kill it
#
# WHY ONE SESSION AND NOT SEVERAL
# -------------------------------
# The pattern is Yegge's Seneschal: "The mobile Claude app lets you see your
# /remote-control sessions, and I designated the Seneschal as my single remote control
# session. I talk to the Seneschal on the phone, who in turn talks to everyone else."
#
# One concierge, not a repo-by-repo list, because the phone is a narrow surface and the
# useful thing to reach from it is the session holding cross-repo context — the wiki,
# CLAUDE.md and the statute book. It reaches Spira through beads; it does not become a
# second control plane.
#
# WHY tmux AND NOT systemd
# ------------------------
# Remote Control needs an interactive session with a TTY. Every aeon on this box already
# runs this way, and tmux means the operator can attach to the same session locally and see
# exactly what the phone sees.
#
# WHY IT RUNS FROM THE HOME CHECKOUT
# ----------------------------------
# The cwd decides which CLAUDE.md, which hooks and which project memory it loads. From
# there it gets the operator's own conventions, their session-start list and their guards.
#
# WHY IT IS COMPOSED FROM A FAYTH
# -------------------------------
# It was not, and that was the defect. An aeon is summoned with a brief, a statute book and a
# model resolved from a file somebody maintains; this session got a working directory and the
# `claude` binary. The operator, 2026-09-12: "when we spin up aeons, they come with a system
# prompt and a set of overlays. you don't. i think that's the defect here."
#
# It was not a difference of degree. `render_memories` — the function that renders the `law-`
# memories in full — is called from `aeon.sh` and from nowhere else, so brain's CLAUDE.md,
# which says the harness "injects a `# Memories in force` section into every agent session at
# summon", described aeons only. The statute that the harness checkout is production had been
# in force for weeks and had never been delivered to the session that kept violating it.
#
# So `chamber/concierge.fayth` and `chamber/concierge.md` now define this session exactly as
# `builder.fayth` defines a Guardian, and what follows renders them. The one property that
# makes the concierge different is declared in the fayth rather than arranged: FAYTH_SUMMON is
# `operator`, and `spira_task_fayths` / `spira_lane_fayths` both refuse to hand it to the
# sentinel. Nothing but a human starts this.
set -uo pipefail

# lib.sh AND NOT conf.sh ALONE. conf.sh resolves configuration; the helpers this file needs —
# `fayth_get` to read the persona and `render_memories` to render the statute book — live in
# lib.sh, which sources conf.sh itself. Sourcing only conf.sh left both as "command not
# found", and the refusal below caught it on the first run, which is what the refusal is for.
