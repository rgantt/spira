# rule.sh — enact, amend, or retire a statute in one command.
#
#   rule.sh enact <slug> "<statute text>"    write it, then synthesise it into the wiki
#   rule.sh retire <slug>                    remove it
#   rule.sh list                             what is in force
#   rule.sh show <slug>                      one statute's full text
#
# `<slug>` is written without the `law-` prefix; it is added for you.
#
# WHY THIS IS A COMMAND AND NOT A CHECKLIST
# -----------------------------------------
# Enacting a statute is two steps — write it to the statute book, regenerate the wiki
# page that is its only git-backed copy — and a rule that depends on remembering a second
# step is a resolution, not a mechanism. The standing lesson here is that when a rule is
# discovered the deliverable is a guard or a command, never a note.
#
# ONE DATABASE. Statutes live in the Spira beads database and nowhere else; that is the
# store every aeon reads its memories from at summon. There is no propagation step,
# because there is nothing to propagate to. `SPIRA_DB` overrides the path, as it does for
# every tool in this repo.
#
# WHEN TO REACH FOR IT
# --------------------
# When the operator answers an escalation, that answer is a verdict. Ask whether it
# generalises; if it does, enact it in the same session with the case that produced it
# as the trailing citation, so the rule carries its own history. The escalation queue should
# be producing law, not just draining — a class of question that keeps coming back is a
# missing statute.
#
# Statutes are read by every agent on every session, so write them to be read a thousand
# times: one paragraph, imperative, ~70 words, the scar as a single clause rather than a
# narrative of how we got here.
